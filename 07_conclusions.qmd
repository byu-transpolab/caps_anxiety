# Conclusions

This study has provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between travel behavior and mental health among young adults with suicidal ideation. By analyzing LBS data and conducting statistical modeling, we uncovered significant differences in activity engagement and motivation levels across different neurological or physiological groups.

The findings indicate that individuals with autism and social anxiety engage in fewer activities compared to the control group, suggesting that these populations face unique challenges in their daily routines and, potentially, in social interactions. In addition, the observed lower motivation levels in the autism and social anxiety groups compared to the control group reveal the profound impact of these conditions on an individual's drive. Specifically, the control group exhibited significantly higher motivation, with the autism group showing greater motivation than the social anxiety group. Another notable finding is the positive relationship between the number of activities and motivation. While each additional activity slightly increases motivation, the practical impact is minimal, suggesting that simply increasing activity engagement is not a sufficient strategy for significantly boosting motivation. Similarly, the negative relationship between distance traveled and motivation, though statistically significant, shows that travel distance has a minor effect on motivation.

These findings matter because they provide a deeper understanding of the unique challenges faced by individuals with autism and social anxiety. For the social anxiety group, increasing activity engagement may help enhance motivation, while for the autism group, other factors might be more influential. The research underscores the importance of personalized interventions that consider the specific needs and characteristics of different groups to effectively improve their mental well-being. In addition, the significant correlations observed in park visits for the control group suggest the positive effects of outdoor green-space activities, while negative correlations in grocery visits highlight potential stressors, particularly for individuals with autism. Tailored interventions are crucial, such as promoting park visits for general well-being and addressing stressors in grocery store environments for individuals with autism.

Moving forward, future research should focus on enhancing data quality and refining methods for activity identification to improve the accuracy of analyses. Longitudinal studies could further explore how changes in travel behavior over time impact mental health outcomes. Additionally, investigating the effectiveness of specific interventions based on travel behavior could provide valuable insights for mental health practitioners.

The contributions of this work lie in bridging the gap between travel behavior and mental health research, highlighting the importance of considering daily activities and travel patterns in mental health interventions. By understanding how travel behavior influences motivation levels and mental well-being, practitioners can develop targeted strategies to support individuals struggling with mental health challenges.

Practically, the findings of this study can inform the development of personalized interventions that take into account an individual's travel behavior and activity engagement. By tailoring interventions to address specific needs related to travel patterns, mental health practitioners can enhance the effectiveness of treatment and support for young adults with suicidal ideation. This research underscores the significance of considering travel behavior as a key factor in promoting mental well-being and offers a roadmap for future studies to explore deeper into this important intersection.
