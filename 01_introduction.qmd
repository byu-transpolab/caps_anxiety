# Introduction

## Purpose

Mental health is a crucial component of holistic well-being, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as “a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to contribute to their community” [@MentalHealthPAHO]. Mental health plays a critical role in shaping individuals’ overall well-being and influences various aspects of daily life, including personal relationships, work productivity, and lifestyle choices.

Mental health has been under increasing strain, partially due to the effects of urbanization and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and social distancing measures restricted access to the natural environment and drastically affected travel habits which brought up additional interest in the connection between individual travel behavior and mental health [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Recent research supports that there are beneficial effects of contact with green and blue spaces on mental health. These spaces are associated with reduced stress, anxiety, and improved mood and cognitive function [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. Furthermore, social isolation and exclusion have been linked to travel behavior and can negatively impact well-being [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011; @stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. Recognizing mental health as a key component of overall well-being motivates the need to analyze the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. 

Determining the relationship between individual travel behavior and one's mental well-being can offer valuable insights for those susceptible to mental health challenges. By understanding the impact of travel behavior on one's mental health, people can make informed choices to travel in a way to promote good mental health, avoiding travel behavior that may be detrimental to their mental health. Travel behavior encapsulates the patterns, choices, and experiences related to individuals' movements from their origin to destination. These travel behaviors include factors such as the number of trips made on a given day and the specific locations where activities occur can influence individual mental health outcomes. Understanding how these travel patterns align with mental health is crucial for designing interventions that foster positive well-being and enhance the quality of life. 

To establish these connections between travel behavior and mental health, it is essential to gather location data for individuals alongside information about their mental well-being. Since raw location-based services (LBS) data lacks details about the nature of activities or travel, the LBS data needs to be transformed into daily activity patterns and trip types. When paired with reported mental health and mood information, this trip data forms a powerful data set, enabling the analysis of the intricate relationship between mental well-being and travel behavior by exploring the interconnectedness of travel patterns and overall wellness, specifically when looking at how different mental health parameters affect the number of activities an individual engages in during the day.

## Scope

@lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 explored the connection between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms using mobile phone-based sensing. Their study identified that activities in different environmental settings can impact anxiety levels, with air pollution and noise associated with higher anxiety, while green spaces, physical activity, and social interaction were linked to lower anxiety. It is important to understand how an individual’s daily travel behavior can affect the individual’s mental health. In this research, we pair a longitudinal survey of mental health collected via a mobile device application with LBS information on the same device. This unique data set allows us to investigate the relationship between changing mental health and changing travel behavior. Understanding the nuanced connections between mental health and travel can inform targeted interventions to address mental health challenges and enhance individuals' overall life satisfaction.

Data for this study come from a longitudinal treatment experiment where 94 study volunteers completed a regular attitudinal survey administered via a mobile device application. This application also collected cellular LBS data from the same individuals, who live in Utah County, Utah. The data was collected for 1 to 6 months. The participants provided metal health information by answering surveys in the mornings and evenings. Questions included: “Have you felt stressed since you last took a survey?”, “How would you rate your overall sleep quality last night?”, and “Have you thought about killing yourself in the past 12 hours or since you last took a survey?” among others. Each of the 94 participants was part of three groups based on a psychological evaluation: control, social anxiety, and autism. This allows the data set to be beneficial to see not only how individual travel behavior affects mental wellness, but specifically how travel behavior affects individuals from neurodiverse groups and vice versa. The LBS data were distilled into semantic activities and locations using a DBSCAN-TE algorithm [@riches2022].

After joining together the semantic activities and the responses to the surveys, statistical models were created to investigate both sides of the relationship between mental health and travel behavior.  Using the Poisson Model, we explore how mental health influences the number of activities individuals undertake. This model incorporates demographic attributes and mental health responses as independent variables, aiming to quantify the influence of mental health on trip frequency. The number of activities serve as the dependent variable. **We also include a longitudinal analysis where we examine the relationship between a person’s daily travel behavior and their mental health status a week later.** Using either a linear regression or a logit choice model, our exploration focuses on understanding how travel behavior shapes mental health or mood. Factors considered may include the specific location of activities and the overall number of activities. These variables are used to predict the mental health outcomes through either a linear regression or logit choice model. The identification of a relationship between travel behavior and mental health has the potential to open up therapeutic and mitigative activities for individuals suffering from depression and suicidality.

## Outline

This thesis will begin by exploring the significance of mental health and its correlation with travel behavior, specifically focusing on the types of activities that a person’s participated in throughout the day. Subsequently, it will outline the techniques employed to identify the activities and journeys of the 94 participants, using the DBSCAN-TE algorithm and previously optimized parameters[@riches2022] . The discussion will encompass the data cleaning process and the compilation of the final dataset containing information on activities and mental health. Following this, the thesis will delve into the creation and analysis of models, shedding light on the insights they provide into the relationship between mental health and individual travel behavior. A subsequent section will merge discussions on travel patterns and mental health outcomes, addressing how to navigate the implications of the newfound information. The conclusion will feature suggestions for future research, a reflection on the study's limitations, and a summary of the key findings.
