# Introduction

## Purpose

The essence of mental health extends far beyond the absence of illness, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions essential for holistic well-being. As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is "a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to contribute to their community" [@MentalHealthPAHO]. This holistic perspective underscores mental health's pervasive influence on personal relationships, work efficacy, and lifestyle choices, accentuating the need to examine its intersection with individual daily behaviors and choices, notably travel behavior.

Travel behavior encapsulates the patterns, choices, and experiences shaping individuals' movements from origin to destination. These behaviors encompass diverse factors such as trip frequency and destination choices. Each person makes these types of choices about their travel nearly every day [@timmermansSpatialContextComplexity2003]. Understanding the impact of these travel patterns on mental well-being is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions that promote positive mental health outcomes while avoiding behaviors detrimental to well-being.

The increasing strain on mental health, partly stemming from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and urbanization, underscores the importance of exploring the interplay between mental health and individuals' daily choices. Among these choices, the impact of how and where individuals allocate their time emerges as particularly interesting. Recent research underscores the therapeutic benefits of engaging with green and blue spaces, ranging from parks and forests to oceans and rivers, in alleviating stress and anxiety, enhancing mood, and bolstering cognitive function [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. However, amidst hectic schedules, prioritizing time for such natural environments can pose significant challenges. Moreover, urbanization exacerbates this predicament by reducing access to these spaces, thereby impeding efforts to foster mental well-being. Likewise, the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing measures further exacerbated this issue by limiting many individuals' interactions with nature, which was one major shift in travel patterns [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Consequently, heightened attention has been drawn to examining the relationship between travel behavior and mental health, particularly against the backdrop of social isolation and exclusion. Studies underscore the adverse impact of reduced travel activities resulting from social isolation on overall well-being, underscoring the need to delve deeper into this association [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011; @stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011].

Unraveling the connection between individual travel patterns and mental well-being holds potential in supporting those grappling with mental health challenges. To establish this linkage, it is crucial to gather location data alongside mental health indicators for individuals on the same day. Yet, the raw location-based services (LBS) data or global positioning services (GPS) data lacks the granularity required to discern specific activities or travel patterns. Consequently, a transformation of this data into daily activity patterns and categorized activity types is essential. Once this transformation is achieved, the combination of daily activity patterns with mental health survey responses yields a comprehensive dataset. This dataset serves as a robust foundation for analyzing the nuanced interplay between mental well-being and travel behavior. By delving into this dataset, we aim to illuminate the relationship between various mental health parameters and individuals' daily activity engagement, thereby providing invaluable insights into overall mental wellness.

## Scope

The data for this research come from a longitudinal study involving 88 volunteers from Utah County, Utah. Collected by the Brigham Young University (BYU) Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) office using Metricwire Software, the data comprise both cellular LBS data and regular attitudinal survey responses, where participants were prompted to complete surveys up to twice daily, in the mornings and evenings. Survey questions encompassed various aspects of mental health, including stress levels, motivation, and thoughts of self-harm. These data were gathered over periods ranging from **1 to 6** **months**, with each participant categorized into one of three groups—control, social anxiety, or autism—based on a psychological evaluation. This unique dataset allows for an exploration of the relationship between mental health status and travel behaviors, with implications for targeted interventions to address mental health issues and enhance overall life satisfaction.

One method used for transforming LBS data into meaningful activities is with clustering algorithms. This thesis uses the DBSCAN-TE algorithm with optimized parameters for noise, time, and entropy [@macfarlaneClassifyingLocationPoints2024]. These optimized parameters enable the algorithm to determine the daily activities of participants accurately. Prior to aplying the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, preprocessing steps were taken to clean and refine the raw LBS data, ensuring its quality and reliability. After implementing the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, subsequent analysis enabled the determination of activity counts at four distinct location types: parks, grocery stores, libraries, and social recreation spaces.

Following the integration of semantic, or interpreted, activities and survey responses, statistical models were constructed to examine the interplay between mental health and travel behavior. Three base models were formulated: ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and random effects models. These models predict individual well-being based on a variable representing travel behavior, with the fixed effects and random effects models accounting for individual baseline differences in well-being. Moreover, data transformations were applied to further understand the impact of the number of activities and distance traveled on reported motivation levels.

Further analysis delved into group-specific well-being and travel patterns, exploring variations across control, social anxiety, and autism groups. Additionally, the study investigated the relationship between suicidality and motivation levels or travel behaviors within these groups. Finally, the impact of engagement in activities at different location types on motivation levels was examined to offer comprehensive insights into the intricate connections between travel behavior and mental well-being.

In conclusion, these are the main foundational components of our research, emphasizing the critical role of mental well-being in shaping travel behavior. By leveraging the DBCAN-TE clustering algorithm and longitudinal data collection methods, we established a robust framework for investigating the interplay between individual travel patterns and mental health outcomes. The unique dataset, comprising LBS data and survey responses from diverse participant groups, provides a rich source of information to explore nuanced relationships and identify potential intervention strategies. Through the development of statistical models and thorough data analysis, we aim to uncover key insights into how travel behavior influences motivation levels and mental health across different demographic groups. By illuminating these connections, our research aims to inform those with mental health challenges how their mental well-being influences their travel behavior.

## Outline

This thesis will begin by exploring the current literature on mental health and well-being, current travel behavior patterns, and characteristics of the different groups. Subsequently, it will outline the techniques employed to identify the activities of the 88 participants, using the DBSCAN-TE algorithm and previously optimized parameters [@macfarlaneClassifyingLocationPoints2024]. The discussion will include the data cleaning process and the compilation of the final dataset containing information on activities engaged in and mental health survey responses. Following this, the thesis will delve into the creation and analysis of models, shedding light on the insights they provide into the relationship between mental health and individual travel behavior. A subsequent section will merge discussions on travel patterns and mental health outcomes, addressing how to navigate the implications of the newfound information. The conclusion will feature suggestions for future research, a reflection on the study's limitations, and a summary of the key findings.
