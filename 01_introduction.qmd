# Introduction

## Purpose

Mental health is a crucial component of holistic well-being, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions. Defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to contribute to their community”, mental health significantly influences various aspects of daily life, including personal relationships, work productivity, and lifestyle choices [@MentalHealthPAHO]. Recognizing mental health as integral to overall well-being underscores the importance of analyzing its relationship with individual daily choices, such as individual travel behavior.

Travel behavior encapsulates the patterns, choices, and experiences related to individuals' movements from their origin to destination. These travel behaviors include factors such as the number of trips made on a given day, the specific locations where activities occur, and which mode was used for the travel. Understanding how these travel patterns impact mental well-being is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions that promote positive mental health outcomes while avoiding behaviors detrimental to well-being.

The increasing strain on mental health, partly attributed to urbanization and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, underscores the importance of exploring connections between mental health and individuals' daily choices. Recent research supports that there are beneficial effects of contact with green spaces, such as parks, forests, meadows, and gardens among others, and blue spaces, such as oceans, ponds, rivers, and canals among others related to mental health. These spaces are associated with reduced stress and anxiety and improved mood and cognitive function [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. However, urbanization has compounded the challenge by limiting access to these spaces, posing obstacles to supporting mental well-being. Moreover, the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing protocols limited people's access to the natural environment including green and blue spaces, prompting a shift in travel habits [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. This situation has sparked increased interest in understanding the relationship between individual travel behavior and mental health, particularly in light of the challenges posed by social isolation and exclusion. Studies have indicated that reduced travel behavior resulting from social isolation can have adverse effects on overall well-being, emphasizing the importance of exploring the connection further [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011; @stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011].

Understanding the correlation between individual travel behavior and mental well-being holds significant potential for aiding those facing mental health difficulties. This necessitates the collection of location data alongside mental health information to establish this link. However, raw location-based services (LBS) data lacks granularity regarding specific activities or travel, thus requiring transformation into daily activity patterns and activity types. By integrating this refined trip data with reported mental health and mood information, a robust dataset emerges, facilitating an analysis of the intricate relationship between mental well-being and travel behavior. This approach sheds light on how various mental health parameters influence an individual's daily activity engagement, offering valuable insights into overall wellness. As well as how daily travel behavior effects mental well-being of individuals.

## Scope

One method used to transform LBS data into semantic, or interpreted activities is clustering algorithms. This thesis uses a methodology that determined optimized parameters for a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, time, and entropy (DBSCAN-TE) algorithm [@riches2022].These optimized parameters allow the algorithm to determine the number of daily activities and the locations of activities that participants engaged in.

Data for this study come from a longitudinal study that 88 volunteers from the Utah County area participated in. The data were collected by the Brigham Young University Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) office using Metricwire Software \[INSERT REFERENCE\]. The Metricwire Software collected cellular LBS data from these volunteers. The volunteers also completed a regular attitudinal survey administered via the Metricwire Software up to twice each day by answering surveys in the mornings and evenings. Questions included: “Have you felt stressed since you last took a survey?”, “How would you rate your overall sleep quality last night?”, and “Have you thought about killing yourself in the past 12 hours or since you last took a survey?” among others. The LBS data and survey data were collected for **1 to 6** months. Each of the 88 participants was part of three groups based on a psychological evaluation: control, social anxiety, and autism. This unique data set allows us to investigate the relationship between changing mental health and changing travel behavior. Understanding the nuanced connections between mental health and travel can inform targeted interventions to address mental health challenges and enhance individuals' overall life satisfaction.

After joining together the semantic activities and the responses to the surveys, statistical models were created to investigate both sides of the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. Using the poisson model, we explored how mental health influences the number of activities individuals participate in. This model incorporates demographic attributes and mental health responses as independent variables, aiming to quantify the influence of mental health on trip frequency. The number of activities serve as the dependent variable. **We also include a longitudinal analysis where we examine the relationship between a the seven day rolling average of activities engaged in on a particular day and their mental health status.** Further analysis was done to understand how travel behavior shapes mental health and well-being. Factors considered may include the specific location of activities and the overall number of activities. These variables are used to predict the mental health outcomes through either a linear regression or logit choice model. The identification of a relationship between travel behavior and mental health has the potential to open up therapeutic and mitigative activities for individuals suffering from depression and suicidality.

## Outline

This thesis will begin by exploring the significance of mental health and its correlation with travel behavior, specifically focusing on the types of activities that a person’s participated in throughout the day. Subsequently, it will outline the techniques employed to identify the activities of the 88 participants, using the DBSCAN-TE algorithm and previously optimized parameters [@macfarlaneClassifyingLocationPoints2024]. The discussion will include the data cleaning process and the compilation of the final dataset containing information on activities engaged in and mental health survey responses. Following this, the thesis will delve into the creation and analysis of models, shedding light on the insights they provide into the relationship between mental health and individual travel behavior. A subsequent section will merge discussions on travel patterns and mental health outcomes, addressing how to navigate the implications of the newfound information. The conclusion will feature suggestions for future research, a reflection on the study's limitations, and a summary of the key findings.
