Few mobility-based studies have investigated the associations between multiple environmental exposures, including social exposures, and mental health.
Objective
To assess how exposure to green space, blue space, noise, air pollution, and crowdedness along people's daily mobility paths are associated with anxiety symptoms.
Methods
358 participants were cross-sectionally tracked with Global Positioning System ({GPS})-enabled mobile phones. Anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 ({GAD}-7) questionnaire. Green space, blue space, noise, and air pollution were assessed based on concentric buffers of 50 m and 100 m around each {GPS} point. Crowdedness was measured by the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices detected along the mobility paths. Multiple linear regressions with full covariate adjustment were fitted to examine anxiety-environmental exposures associations. Random forest models were applied to explore possible nonlinear associations and exposure interactions.
Results
Regression results showed null linear associations between {GAD}-7 scores and environmental exposures. Random forest models indicated that {GAD}-7-environment associations varied nonlinearly with exposure levels. We found a negative association between green space and {GAD}-7 scores only for participants with moderate green space exposure. We observed a positive association between {GAD}-7 scores and noise levels above 60 {dB} and air pollution concentrations above 17.2 μg m−3. Crowdedness was positively associated with {GAD}-7 scores, but exposure-response functions flattened out with pronounced crowdedness of {\textgreater}7.5. Blue space tended to be positively associated with {GAD}-7 scores. Random forest models ranked environmental exposures as more important to explain {GAD}-7 scores than linear models.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate possible nonlinear associations between mobility-based environmental exposures and anxiety symptoms. More studies are needed to obtain an in-depth understanding of underlying anxiety-environment mechanisms during daily life.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Travel requires various skills such as concentration, interpretation of information, and the confidence to take decisions and interact with other people. Mental illness can affect these skills and so cause barriers to travel. These issues are explored in this paper using the results from a cross-sectional on-line survey.
Methods
The survey focussed on domestic travel. The link to the survey was distributed by eighteen mental health or transport organizations and three individuals through social media, newsletters and websites. Weightings were applied to make the results more representative of the national population with mental health conditions.
Results
89\% of the respondents had anxiety and 76\% were depressed. The biggest cause of anxiety was interacting with fellow travellers, both in terms of how they behaved and how the respondents felt that others perceived them. The second main cause of anxiety was needing support when travelling, both feeling out of control and requiring help from other people. Having to feel in control reflected another cause of anxiety: having to take action in an unfamiliar environment, because the method of travel has failed or because of the need to find suitable toilet facilities. Wayfinding caused anxiety in terms of feelings of disorientation, being lost and having to find the way. The fifth area of anxiety revolved around interacting with staff such as bus drivers and buying tickets. A high proportion of respondents had fluctuations in their health condition from day to day that meant that sometimes they could not leave home. Many of them were unable to commit to buying rail tickets in advance.
Conclusions
People with mental health conditions have difficulty travelling because of various barriers that they face. Changes such as clearer, comprehensive travel information, better-designed buses, trains and infrastructure and quieter, calmer, less crowded journeys would enable them to travel more.},

The evidence from the surveys presented in this paper shows that more women than men have panic attacks, but that more men than women have communication difficulties. More women than men are prevented by their mental health condition from leaving home, using bus, rail and metro and from buying rail tickets in advance. Significantly more women than men suffered from the following anxieties when travelling: the need for support, wayfinding, interacting with fellow travellers and concerns about the failure of the bus, train or car. For women, the greatest need seems to be policies and actions that will increase their confidence when travelling such as access to staff when assistance is required and clear information when travelling, plus the opportunity to receive travel training. More men than women wanted improvements to the travelling environment, such as less clutter on the street. Summing up, implementing improvements to increase confidence when travelling could help to reduce gender inequalities.},

Moreover, multilevel modelling with instrumental variables is used, so that the heterogeneity of other household members’ activity–travel patterns can be included. Considering the heterogeneity effects of other household members, this study shows that {TS} has a positive correlation with both social health ({SH}) and mental health ({MH}). The model shows that those who stay at home and work or study longer tend to have a high {TS}, and in turn high {SH} and {MH}. It can be understood that people who have longer time commitments to obligatory activities appreciate their trips more because they are observed to have the lowest {MH} conditions. Longer times spent on studying and working and in-home activities are indicated to limit people’s participation with other household members, which in turn correlates with low {MH}. Any efforts to undertake more travel for those who have more commitments at home and in the workplace can result in better {TS} and in turn {SH} and {MH}. This study confirms that more regular daily activity–travel patterns with regular breaks from obligatory activities are observed to correspond to better {MH}. More regular daily activity–travel patterns of other household members can make individuals organise their own more regular activity–travel patterns, which correlates with better {SH} and {MH}.},

Research over the last thirty years has focused on investigating the mechanisms through which specific elements of the built environment, such as indoor air quality, influence the physical health of occupants.

One in five Americans has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder in the past year, and, in the United States, the number of suicide deaths are similar to the number of deaths due to breast cancer. Increases in mental health disorders in Western societies may be due, in part, to increased systemic inflammation, secondary to decreased exposures to a diverse microbial environment (i.e., the hygiene hypothesis, “Old Friends” hypothesis, “missing microbes” hypothesis, or biodiversity hypothesis), as well as increased environmental exposures that lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. In this review, we provide an assessment that integrates historical research across disciplines. We offer ten questions that highlight the importance of current lessons learned regarding the built environment and mental health, including a potential role for the microbiome of the built environment to influence mental health.

There is increasing evidence that the level of exposure to natural environments impacts mental health, but few large-scale epidemiological studies have assessed the general existence and importance of such associations. Here, we investigate the prospective association between green space and mental health in the Danish population. Green space presence was assessed at the individual level using high-resolution satellite data to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index within a 210 × 210 m square around each person’s place of residence (∼1 million people) from birth to the age of 10. We show that high levels of green space presence during childhood are associated with lower risk of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders later in life. Risk for subsequent mental illness for those who lived with the lowest level of green space during childhood was up to 55\% higher across various disorders compared with those who lived with the highest level of green space. The association remained even after adjusting for urbanization, socioeconomic factors, parental history of mental illness, and parental age. Stronger association of cumulative green space presence during childhood compared with single-year green space presence suggests that presence throughout childhood is important. Our results show that green space during childhood is associated with better mental health, supporting efforts to better integrate natural environments into urban planning and childhood life.},

	abstract = {Background
Although exposure to natural outdoor environments has been consistently associated with improved perceived general health, available evidence on a protective association between this exposure and specific mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety is still limited.
Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medication. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential mediators and effect modifiers of this association.
Methods
The study was based on an existing adult cohort ({ALFA} – Alzheimer and Families) and includes 958 adult participants from Barcelona recruited in 2013–2014. For each participant residential green and blue exposure indicators [surrounding greenness ({NDVI}), amount of green (land-cover) and access to major green spaces and blue spaces] were generated for different buffers (100m, 300m and 500m). Participants reported their history of doctor-diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders and intake of related medication. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the corresponding associations.
Results
Increasing surrounding greenness was associated with reduced odds of self-reported history of benzodiazepines [e.g. Odds ratio - {OR} (95\%{CI}) = 0.62 (0.43, 0.89) for 1-interquartile range ({IQR}) increase in {NDVI} in a 300m buffer] and access to major green spaces was associated with self-reported history of depression [{OR} (95\%{CI}) = 0.18 (0.06, 0.58)]. No statistically significant associations were observed with blue spaces. Air pollution (between 0.8\% and 29.6\%) and noise (between 2.2\% and 5.3\%) mediated a proportion of the associations observed, whereas physical activity and social support played a minor role.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest a potential protective role of green spaces on mental health (depression and anxiety) in adults, but further studies, especially longitudinal studies, are needed to provide further evidence of these benefits and of the mediation role of exposures like air pollution and noise.},

	abstract = {Objective
Disease containment of {COVID}-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents.
Method
For this rapid review, we searched {MEDLINE}, {PsycInfo}, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29, 2020. Of the articles, 20\% were double screened using predefined criteria, and 20\% of data was double extracted for quality assurance.
Results
A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n = 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were longitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness.
Conclusion
Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.},

Key influences on social exclusion are discussed, with trip making emerging as a significant influence. Trip making is not a significant direct influence on well-being but does exercise an indirect influence through the impact on risk of social exclusion. The modelling process enables a value for additional trips to be estimated, the value being about four times the values derived from conventional generated traffic approaches. Similar high values are found in separate metropolitan and regional case studies, confirming the significance of the results.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the separate and combined effects of transport disadvantage and social exclusion on well-being using an empirical analysis of data from a travel and disadvantage survey in Victoria, Australia. Previous research explores the impact of transport on social exclusion but does not study the downstream impacts on well-being. To explore this relationship measures of subjective well-being are compared across four groups: (i) people who are neither transport disadvantaged nor socially excluded, (ii) transport disadvantaged only, (iii) socially excluded only and (iv) both transport disadvantaged and socially excluded. The paper explores which component aspects of social exclusion and transport disadvantage have the greatest impact on well-being and which social groups are most likely to face transport disadvantage and social exclusion together. The paper concludes with a commentary on how the findings might be used to better target policy interventions meant to improve well-being.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that ecosystem services and especially the exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) have potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The {COVID}-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) People will show greater symptoms of depression and anxiety under lockdown conditions that did not allow contact with outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature spaces was strictly restricted, (2a) those with green/blue nature view or (2b) access to private outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a more positive mood. Based on 5218 responses from 9 countries, we found that lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts, especially for those under strict lockdown. People under strict lockdown in Spain (3403 responses), perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health, using the benefits that ecosystem services are providing us.},

	abstract = {Living near, recreating in, and feeling psychologically connected to, the natural world are all associated with better mental health, but many exposure-related questions remain. Using data from an 18-country survey (n = 16,307) we explored associations between multiple measures of mental health (positive well-being, mental distress, depression/anxiety medication use) and: (a) exposures (residential/recreational visits) to different natural settings (green/inland-blue/coastal-blue spaces); and (b) nature connectedness, across season and country. People who lived in greener/coastal neighbourhoods reported higher positive well-being, but this association largely disappeared when recreational visits were controlled for. Frequency of recreational visits to green, inland-blue, and coastal-blue spaces in the last 4 weeks were all positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress. Associations with green space visits were relatively consistent across seasons and countries but associations with blue space visits showed greater heterogeneity. Nature connectedness was also positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress and was, along with green space visits, associated with a lower likelihood of using medication for depression. By contrast inland-blue space visits were associated with a greater likelihood of using anxiety medication. Results highlight the benefits of multi-exposure, multi-response, multi-country studies in exploring complexity in nature-health associations.},

This paper provides an overview of current concepts of positive mental health and its contribution to the health and well-being of society. Frameworks for promoting mental health are presented, together with an overview of key concepts and principles underpinning this multi-disciplinary area of practice. Drawing on empirical studies, the article reviews the determinants of positive mental health across the lifespan. Enhancing factors for promoting mental health at the structural, community and individual levels are identified. The growing evidence base on the effectiveness of mental health promotion interventions is discussed, and the implications of addressing the psychosocial determinants of mental health for policy and practice are considered.},

	abstract = {{GPS} sensors on smart phones facilitate collecting and analyzing spatial-temporal information of the phone holders. Before carrying further analysis on these data, splitting continuous {GPS} trajectories is necessary in data processing. This paper proposes a two-step methodology (a density-based clustering algorithm in the first step and {SVMs} (support vector machines) in the second step) to deal with {GPS} data without speed or acceleration features which are usually used as key attributes in the rule-based methodologies. Entropy is used as an updated constraint to remove the erroneously identified stopping points, which leads to 1.5\% improvement in the overall accuracy compared with an earlier version of the methodology. The output from the first step also make the {SVMs} have a better performance.},
