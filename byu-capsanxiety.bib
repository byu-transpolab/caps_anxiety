This paper provides an overview of current concepts of positive mental health and its contribution to the health and well-being of society. Frameworks for promoting mental health are presented, together with an overview of key concepts and principles underpinning this multi-disciplinary area of practice. Drawing on empirical studies, the article reviews the determinants of positive mental health across the lifespan. Enhancing factors for promoting mental health at the structural, community and individual levels are identified. The growing evidence base on the effectiveness of mental health promotion interventions is discussed, and the implications of addressing the psychosocial determinants of mental health for policy and practice are considered.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, travel patterns have become more complex and policy makers demand more detailed information. As a result, conventional data collection methods seem no longer adequate to satisfy all data needs. Travel researchers around the world are currently experimenting with different Global Positioning System (GPS)-based data collection methods. An overview of the literature shows the potential of these methods, especially when algorithms that include spatial data are used to derive trip characteristics from the GPS logs. This article presents an innovative method that combines GPS logs, Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and an interactive web-based validation application. In particular, this approach concentrates on the issue of deriving and validating trip purposes and travel modes, as well as allowing for reliable multi-day data collection. In 2007, this method was used in practice in a large-scale study conducted in the Netherlands. In total, 1104 respondents successfully participated in the one-week survey. The project demonstrated that GPS-based methods now provide reliable multi-day data. In comparison with data from the Dutch Travel Survey, travel mode and trip purpose shares were almost equal while more trips per tour were recorded, which indicates the ability of collecting trips that are missed by paper diary methods.},

Previous research explores the impact of transport on social exclusion but does not study the downstream impacts on well-being. To explore this relationship measures of subjective well-being are compared across four groups: (i) people who are neither transport disadvantaged nor socially excluded, (ii) transport disadvantaged only, (iii) socially excluded only and (iv) both transport disadvantaged and socially excluded. The paper explores which component aspects of social exclusion and transport disadvantage have the greatest impact on well-being and which social groups are most likely to face transport disadvantage and social exclusion together. The paper concludes with a commentary on how the findings might be used to better target policy interventions meant to improve well-being.},

  abstract = {With the availability of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to capture vehicle location, it is now feasible to easily collect multiple days of travel data automatically. However, GPS-collected data are not ready for direct use in trip rate or route choice research until trip ends are identified within large GPS data streams. One common parameter used to divide trips is dwell time, the time a vehicle is stationary. Identifying trips is particularly challenging when there is trip chaining with brief stops, such as picking up and dropping off passengers. It is hard to distinguish these stops from those caused by traffic controls or congestion. Although the dwell time method is effective in many cases, it is not foolproof and recent research indicates use of additional logic improves trip dividing. While some studies incorporating more than dwell time to identify trip ends having been conducted, research including actual trip ends to evaluate the success of trip dividing methods used have been limited. In this research, 12 ten-day real-world GPS travel datasets were used to develop, calibrate and compare three methods to identify trip start points in the data stream. The true start and end points of each trip were identified in advance in the GPS data stream using a supplemental trip log completed by the participants so that the accuracy of each automated trip division method could be measured and compared. A heuristic model, which combines heading change, dwell time and distance between the GPS points and the road network, performs best, correctly identifying 94\% of trip ends.},

Although OPTICS [M. Ankerst, M.M. Breunig, H.-P. Kriegel, J. Sander, OPTICS: ordering points to identify the clustering structure, in: A. Delis, C. Faloutsos, S. Ghandeharizadeh (Eds.), Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Philadelphia, PA, ACM, New York, 1999, pp. 49{\textendash}60] provides an augmented ordering of the database to represent its density-based clustering structure, it only generates the clusters with local-density exceeds certain thresholds but not the cluster of similar local-density; in addition, it does not produce clusters of a data set explicitly. Furthermore, the parameters required by almost all the major clustering algorithms are hard to determine although they significantly impact on the clustering result. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm LDBSCAN relying on a local-density-based notion of clusters is proposed. In this technique, the selection of appropriate parameters is not difficult; it also takes the advantage of the LOF [M.M. Breunig, H.-P. Kriegel, R.T. Ng, J.

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medication. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential mediators and effect modifiers of this association. Methods The study was based on an existing adult cohort (ALFA {\textendash} Alzheimer and Families) and includes 958 adult participants from Barcelona recruited in 2013{\textendash}2014. For each participant residential green and blue exposure indicators [surrounding greenness (NDVI), amount of green (land-cover) and access to major green spaces and blue spaces] were generated for different buffers (100m, 300m and 500m). Participants reported their history of doctor-diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders and intake of related medication. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the corresponding associations. Results Increasing surrounding greenness was associated with reduced odds of self-reported history of benzodiazepines [e.g. Odds ratio - OR (95\%CI) = 0.62 (0.43, 0.89) for 1-interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI in a 300m buffer] and access to major green spaces was associated with self-reported history of depression [OR (95\%CI) = 0.18 (0.06, 0.58)]. No statistically significant associations were observed with blue spaces. Air pollution (between 0.8\% and 29.6\%) and noise (between 2.2\% and 5.3\%) mediated a proportion of the associations observed, whereas physical activity and social support played a minor role. Conclusion Our findings suggest a potential protective role of green spaces on mental health (depression and anxiety) in adults, but further studies, especially longitudinal studies, are needed to provide further evidence of these benefits and of the mediation role of exposures like air pollution and noise.},

Research over the last thirty years has focused on investigating the mechanisms through which specific elements of the built environment, such as indoor air quality, influence the physical health of occupants. However, similar effort has not been expended in regard to mental health, a significant public health concern. One in five Americans has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder in the past year, and, in the United States, the number of suicide deaths are similar to the number of deaths due to breast cancer. Increases in mental health disorders in Western societies may be due, in part, to increased systemic inflammation, secondary to decreased exposures to a diverse microbial environment (i.e., the hygiene hypothesis, ``Old Friends'' hypothesis, ``missing microbes'' hypothesis, or biodiversity hypothesis), as well as increased environmental exposures that lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. In this review, we provide an assessment that integrates historical research across disciplines. We offer ten questions that highlight the importance of current lessons learned regarding the built environment and mental health, including a potential role for the microbiome of the built environment to influence mental health. Suggested areas for future investigation are also highlighted.},

Clustering techniques are important when it comes to extracting knowledge from large amount of spatial data collected from various applications including GIS, satellite images, X-ray crystallography, remote sensing and environmental assessment and planning etc. To extract useful pattern from these complex data sources several popular spatial data clustering techniques have been proposed. DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a pioneer density based algorithm. It can discover clusters of any arbitrary shape and size in databases containing even noise and outliers. DBSCAN however are known to have a number of problems such as: (a) it requires user's input to specify parameter values for executing the algorithm; (b) it is prone to dilemma in deciding meaningful clusters from datasets with varying densities; (c) and it incurs certain computational complexity. Many researchers attempted to enhance the basic DBSCAN algorithm, in order to overcome these drawbacks, such as VDBSCAN, FDBSCAN, DD\_DBSCAN, and IDBSCAN. In this study, we survey over different variations of DBSCAN algorithms that were proposed so far. These variations are critically evaluated and their limitations are also listed.},

  abstract = {Background Few mobility-based studies have investigated the associations between multiple environmental exposures, including social exposures, and mental health. Objective To assess how exposure to green space, blue space, noise, air pollution, and crowdedness along people's daily mobility paths are associated with anxiety symptoms. Methods 358 participants were cross-sectionally tracked with Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled mobile phones. Anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. Green space, blue space, noise, and air pollution were assessed based on concentric buffers of 50 m and 100 m around each GPS point. Crowdedness was measured by the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices detected along the mobility paths. Multiple linear regressions with full covariate adjustment were fitted to examine anxiety-environmental exposures associations. Random forest models were applied to explore possible nonlinear associations and exposure interactions. Results Regression results showed null linear associations between GAD-7 scores and environmental exposures. Random forest models indicated that GAD-7-environment associations varied nonlinearly with exposure levels. We found a negative association between green space and GAD-7 scores only for participants with moderate green space exposure. We observed a positive association between GAD-7 scores and noise levels above 60 dB and air pollution concentrations above 17.2 {$\mu$}g m-3. Crowdedness was positively associated with GAD-7 scores, but exposure-response functions flattened out with pronounced crowdedness of {$>$}7.5. Blue space tended to be positively associated with GAD-7 scores. Random forest models ranked environmental exposures as more important to explain GAD-7 scores than linear models. Conclusions Our findings indicate possible nonlinear associations between mobility-based environmental exposures and anxiety symptoms. More studies are needed to obtain an in-depth understanding of underlying anxiety-environment mechanisms during daily life.},

  abstract = {Objective Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. Method For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29, 2020. Of the articles, 20\% were double screened using predefined criteria, and 20\% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. Results A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n~= 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were longitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. Conclusion Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.},

In most existing work, trajectories are usually divided into a set of stops and moves. In trajectories, stops represent the most important and meaningful part of the trajectory; there are many data mining methods to extract these locations. DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is a classical density-based algorithm used to find the high-density areas in space, and different derivative methods of this algorithm have been proposed to find the stops in trajectories. However, most of these methods required a manually-set threshold, such as the speed threshold, for each feature variable. In our research, we first defined our new concept of move ability. Second, by introducing the theory of data fields and by taking our new concept of move ability into consideration, we constructed a new, comprehensive, hybrid feature{\textendash}based, density measurement method which considers temporal and spatial properties. Finally, an improved DBSCAN algorithm was proposed using our new density measurement method. In the Experimental Section, the effectiveness and efficiency of our method is validated against real datasets. When comparing our algorithm with the classical density-based clustering algorithms, our experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Introduction Travel requires various skills such as concentration, interpretation of information, and the confidence to take decisions and interact with other people. Mental illness can affect these skills and so cause barriers to travel. These issues are explored in this paper using the results from a cross-sectional on-line survey. Methods The survey focussed on domestic travel. The link to the survey was distributed by eighteen mental health or transport organizations and three individuals through social media, newsletters and websites. Weightings were applied to make the results more representative of the national population with mental health conditions. Results 89\% of the respondents had anxiety and 76\% were depressed. The biggest cause of anxiety was interacting with fellow travellers, both in terms of how they behaved and how the respondents felt that others perceived them. The second main cause of anxiety was needing support when travelling, both feeling out of control and requiring help from other people. Having to feel in control reflected another cause of anxiety: having to take action in an unfamiliar environment, because the method of travel has failed or because of the need to find suitable toilet facilities. Wayfinding caused anxiety in terms of feelings of disorientation, being lost and having to find the way. The fifth area of anxiety revolved around interacting with staff such as bus drivers and buying tickets. A high proportion of respondents had fluctuations in their health condition from day to day that meant that sometimes they could not leave home. Many of them were unable to commit to buying rail tickets in advance. Conclusions People with mental health conditions have difficulty travelling because of various barriers that they face. Changes such as clearer, comprehensive travel information, better-designed buses, trains and infrastructure and quieter, calmer, less crowded journeys would enable them to travel more.},

Responses from 363 people have been weighted by figures from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2014 to make them representative of the population with mental illness in England. The evidence from the surveys presented in this paper shows that more women than men have panic attacks, but that more men than women have communication difficulties. More women than men are prevented by their mental health condition from leaving home, using bus, rail and metro and from buying rail tickets in advance. Significantly more women than men suffered from the following anxieties when travelling: the need for support, wayfinding, interacting with fellow travellers and concerns about the failure of the bus, train or car. For women, the greatest need seems to be policies and actions that will increase their confidence when travelling such as access to staff when assistance is required and clear information when travelling, plus the opportunity to receive travel training. More men than women wanted improvements to the travelling environment, such as less clutter on the street. Summing up, implementing improvements to increase confidence when travelling could help to reduce gender inequalities.},

While common mental health disorders are generally linked to demographic and socioeconomic factors, little is known about the interaction with the urban environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) People will show greater symptoms of depression and anxiety under lockdown conditions that did not allow contact with outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature spaces was strictly restricted, (2a) those with green/blue nature view or (2b) access to private outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a more positive mood. Based on 5218 responses from 9 countries, we found that lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts, especially for those under strict lockdown. People under strict lockdown in Spain (3403 responses), perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health, using the benefits that ecosystem services are providing us.},

We included studies that measured depressive symptoms or depression and had measures of urbanization, population density, aesthetics of living environment, house/built environment, green areas, walkability, noise, air pollution or services.Results:Out of 1,578 articles found, 44 studies met our inclusion criteria. Manual searches of the references yielded 13 articles, resulting in 57 articles being included in the systematic review. Most of the studies showed statistically significant associations with at least one of the characteristics of living environment and depressive mood. House and built environment with, for example, poor housing quality and non-functioning, lack of green areas, noise and air pollution were more clearly related to depressive mood even after adjustment for different individual characteristics. On the contrary, the results in relation to population density, aesthetics and walkability of living environment, and availability of services and depressive mood were more inconsistent.Conclusion:Adverse house/built environment, including poor housing quality and non-functioning, lack of green spaces, noise and air pollution are related to depressive mood and should be taken into account during planning in order to prevent depressive mood.},

Key influences on social exclusion are discussed, with trip making emerging as a significant influence. Trip making is not a significant direct influence on well-being but does exercise an indirect influence through the impact on risk of social exclusion. The modelling process enables a value for additional trips to be estimated, the value being about four times the values derived from conventional generated traffic approaches. Similar high values are found in separate metropolitan and regional case studies, confirming the significance of the results.},

Moreover, multilevel modelling with instrumental variables is used, so that the heterogeneity of other household members' activity{\textendash}travel patterns can be included. Considering the heterogeneity effects of other household members, this study shows that TS has a positive correlation with both social health (SH) and mental health (MH). The model shows that those who stay at home and work or study longer tend to have a high TS, and in turn high SH and MH. It can be understood that people who have longer time commitments to obligatory activities appreciate their trips more because they are observed to have the lowest MH conditions. Longer times spent on studying and working and in-home activities are indicated to limit people's participation with other household members, which in turn correlates with low MH. Any efforts to undertake more travel for those who have more commitments at home and in the workplace can result in better TS and in turn SH and MH. This study confirms that more regular daily activity{\textendash}travel patterns with regular breaks from obligatory activities are observed to correspond to better MH. More regular daily activity{\textendash}travel patterns of other household members can make individuals organise their own more regular activity{\textendash}travel patterns, which correlates with better SH and MH.},

Despite the wealth of GPS surveys available to practitioners to work with, the existing studies have not made much progress to deliver models for identification of activities from GPS data streams. The lack of models for identifying activities prevents the reconstruction of activity patterns stored in GPS data streams. The present study proposes a methodology for the identification of activities using a rule-based and discrete choice modeling. This novel approach uses a rule-based model that implements the properties of home-based tours in the form of the feedback loop in order to allow identification of home activities. This model is inert to the presence of travel characteristics as it can be applied to most multi-day GPS data sets, and not just prompted recall surveys. In regard to the non-home activities, a discrete choice model is calibrated to Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), for identification of work and other activities. The estimated results are positive, as they are compared against the TTS, and are consistent with the observed patterns.},

Using data from an 18-country survey (n\,=\,16,307) we explored associations between multiple measures of mental health (positive well-being, mental distress, depression/anxiety medication use) and: (a) exposures (residential/recreational visits) to different natural settings (green/inland-blue/coastal-blue spaces); and (b) nature connectedness, across season and country. People who lived in greener/coastal neighbourhoods reported higher positive well-being, but this association largely disappeared when recreational visits were controlled for. Frequency of recreational visits to green, inland-blue, and coastal-blue spaces in the last 4~weeks were all positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress. Associations with green space visits were relatively consistent across seasons and countries but associations with blue space visits showed greater heterogeneity. Nature connectedness was also positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress and was, along with green space visits, associated with a lower likelihood of using medication for depression. By contrast inland-blue space visits were associated with a greater likelihood of using anxiety medication.

Trip characteristics, including trip ends, travel modes, and trip purposes need to be detected from GPS data. Compared with other trip characteristics, studies on trip purpose detection are limited. These studies struggle with three types of limitations, namely, data validation, classification approach-related issues, and result comparison under multiple scenarios. Therefore, we attempt to obtain full understanding and improve these three aspects when detecting trip purposes in the current study. First, a smartphone-based travel survey is employed to collect GPS data, and a surveyor-intervened prompted recall survey is used to validate trip characteristics automatically detected from the GPS data. Second, artificial neural networks combined with particle swarm optimization are used to detect trip purposes from the GPS data. Third, four scenarios are constructed by employing two methods for land-use type coding, i.e., polygon-based information and point of interest, and two methods for selecting training dataset, i.e., equal proportion selection and equal number selection. The accuracy of trip purpose detection is then compared under these scenarios. The highest accuracies of 97.22\% for the training dataset and 96.53\% for the test dataset are achieved under the scenario of polygon-based information and equal proportion selection by comparing the detected and validated trip purposes. Promising results indicate that a smartphone-based travel survey can complement conventional travel surveys.},
