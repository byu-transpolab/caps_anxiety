# Quarto template

This repository creates a template article that can be converted into a website,
an academic article PDF, and (eventually) a BYU Engineering thesis. This
template also implements the workflow presented in my [lab
documentation](https://gregmacfarlane.github.io/lab/workflow.html).

The \_targets built folder is at
