# Literature Review

Mental health and well-being are complex issues influenced by a multitude of factors, including social, economic, and environmental elements. Addressing these determinants is essential for promoting individual well-being [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009]. Additionally, travel behavior has been recognized as a significant factor impacting social and mental health [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. In this review, we explore current research on the effects of built and natural environments, social isolation, travel behavior, and activity locations on mental health and well-being. We also examine the well-being and travel behavior of individuals with autism and social anxiety. Ultimately, we integrate these factors to highlight how our research aims to fill an existing gap in the literature.

## Impacts of Built and Natural Environment

In recent years, a growing body of research has explored the relationship and association between built and natural environments and mental health [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018; @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018; @engemann2019; @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. The findings of these studies specifically investigate the association between the urban environment, green and blue spaces, and mental health.

In a study conducted in Brussels, Belgium, researchers investigated the association between urban environment and mental health. The researchers found that exposure to noise pollution, air pollution, and lack of green space were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress. In contrast, living close to green space was associated with lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021]. A systematic review of the literature on the relationship between the living environment and depressive mood found similar results and confirmed the study by @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021 [@rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018]. In addition to the literature review by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, @engemann2019 conducted a study to investigate the relationship between residential green space in childhood and the risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood. The study found that individuals who grew up in areas with more residential green space had a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders. This may indicate that having access to green space as a child can affect one's mental health in the future.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to natural environments became more limited for many people due to lock downs and social distancing measures. A study in Spain found that access to blue-green spaces, like coastal areas or parks, during the pandemic lockdown benefited mental health. Surveyed individuals with access to these spaces reported lower stress and anxiety levels compared to those without such access. [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Independent of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional research supports the idea that access to natural environments can contribute to positive mental health outcomes. A study across 18 countries found that access to green and blue spaces was linked to better mental health and well-being. Specifically, green spaces were associated with lower depression and anxiety levels, while blue spaces improved mood and cognitive function [@whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. Providing individuals with access to green and blue spaces can promote positive mental health outcomes, particularly during times of stress and adversity such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the research suggests that access to and time spent in natural environments can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being.

## Impacts of Social Isolation

Social isolation, or social exclusion, affects individuals' mental health. When looking specifically at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, @loadesRapidSystematicReview2020 focused on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of children and adolescents. The authors conducted a rapid systematic review of existing literature on the topic and found that social isolation and loneliness can have a negative impact on mental health, including increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009 reviewed the determinants of positive mental health, emphasizing the importance of social support and social connectedness, a sense of control and autonomy, self-esteem, and meaning and purpose in life. She argues that mental health promotion should focus on building resilience, enhancing positive emotions, and developing skills and competencies to manage adversity. Many of those competencies are related to social interactions and avoiding social isolation [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009].

While significant periods of isolation, like during the COVID lockdowns, reduced social interactions, everyday sociality is influenced by one's ability to travel. Researchers in Melbourne, Australia, studied the link between mobility, social exclusion, and well-being. They found that increased mobility improves well-being and reduces social exclusion, positively impacting mental health [@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. Another study in Melbourne, Australia, explored how transport disadvantage and social exclusion affect well-being. Using survey data, researchers found that both factors negatively impact well-being, with social exclusion having a stronger effect [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. The ability and choice to make trips affects well-being and mental health of individuals.

Overall, these results suggest that social exclusion and isolation, transport disadvantage, and loneliness can negatively impact individual well-being and mental health. On the other hand, mobility and contact with others can have a positive impact on individual well-being. These findings highlight the importance of social support networks and access to transportation.

## Impacts of Travel Behavior.

Research on travel patterns highlights the relationship between travel behavior and individuals' social and mental well-being. @syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022 conducted a study in the Bandung Metropolitan area to investigate the effect of travel satisfaction, linked to mental health, and activity-travel patterns of household members. This study showed that travel satisfaction is positively correlated with social health and mental health. Individuals who spent more time working or studying at home had higher travel satisfaction, leading to better social and mental health. However, extended time on obligatory activities limited interactions with household members, which negatively affected mental health. Encouraging travel for those with significant commitments can enhance travel satisfaction, social health, and mental health. Additionally, regular daily activity-travel patterns with breaks from obligations were linked to improved mental health.

Similarly, another study investigated how travel affects emotional well-being and life satisfaction. The researchers pointed out that those who regularly traveled to work experienced less life satisfaction than those who worked from home. However, the study revealed a positive association between general travel and emotional well-being, indicating that travel experiences contribute to improved mood and overall life satisfaction. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of integrating travel into daily routines to foster better mental health and overall well-being [@frimanHowDoesTravel2017].

Exploring the relationship between gender, mental health, and travel, @mackettGenderMentalHealth2022 conducted a comprehensive study and found that women tended to experience higher levels of mental health issues related to travel, such as anxiety and stress, due to factors like route finding, safety concerns, and interacting with others. Another study by @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 explored the relationship between mental health and travel behavior, finding that active travel, such as walking or cycling, and public transportation use were associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced stress and improved well-being. This study highlighted the complexity of the relationship, noting that mental health issues can affect one's ability to travel, and travel can also influence mental health issues.

The reviewed studies highlight the significant influence of travel behavior on social and mental health outcomes. Factors such as travel satisfaction, activity-travel patterns of household members, and gender differences play crucial roles in shaping these outcomes. Positive travel experiences are associated with improved emotional well-being and life satisfaction. However, it is essential to consider the potential challenges and disparities faced by different genders in relation to mental health and travel.

## Impacts of Activity Types


People engage in various types of activities often and different types of activity locations impact mental health and overall well-being. We will examine activities occurring at green spaces, grocery stores, libraries, and social recreation locations to understand how these environments influence individuals' mental health and well-being. For instance, @takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022 found that the types of activities people engage in can significantly affect the extent of positive emotions elicited. By analyzing these various settings, we aim to uncover the potential benefits and implications of these activity locations on mental health and overall well-being.


### Green Spaces

The role of green spaces in enhancing mental well-being has increasingly captured attention, with numerous studies attesting to their beneficial effects across diverse demographics and environments. This section delves into the impact of spending time in green spaces on mental health.

Primarily, exposure to nature consistently correlates with reduced stress, anxiety, and depression levels. For instance, participants who embarked on a 90-minute walk in natural settings exhibited decreased activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex—a region linked to rumination and heightened mental health risks—compared to urban walkers [@bratmanNatureExperienceReduces2015]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 25 studies indicated that natural environments positively influence overall mental well-being, predominantly through participants' self-reported emotional states [@bowlerSystematicReviewEvidence2010].

Long-term exposure to green spaces also yields positive mental health outcomes. Research by @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018 revealed lower anxiety and depression levels in adults residing near green and blue spaces. Similarly, participants perceiving significant greenery in their neighborhoods exhibited notably better physical and mental health outcomes [@sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008]. Further, a study found that living in areas increased green space concentration was correlated with lower salivary cortisol levels, indicative of reduced stress [@roeGreenSpaceStress2013]. Time spent in green spaces is associated with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Moreover, green spaces foster social interaction and community cohesion, pivotal for mental well-being. In a study by @sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008 that analyzed the greenness of neighborhoods, participants highlighted community closeness, neighborly assistance, and engagement in informal social activities, all correlating with improved mental health in green areas. These factors underscore the significance of green spaces beyond their direct impact on mental well-being.

While the relationship between green spaces and mental health is intricate, recent studies uniformly advocate for their positive influence. In sum, exposure to green spaces not only alleviates stress, anxiety, and depression but also cultivates social connections, rendering them a promising avenue for enhancing mental health and overall well-being.

### Grocery Stores

Supermarkets and grocery stores are integral to modern life, serving as essential hubs for purchasing food and household necessities. However, the experience of shopping in these environments can influence individuals' mental well-being. This section aims to delve into the effects of time spent in grocery stores on mental health.

While research on the effects of grocery store visits on mental health remains relatively scarce, recent studies have increasingly shed light on this area, particularly amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for the purpose of this thesis, discussions regarding pandemic-related influences on mental health outcomes in the context of grocery store visits will be omitted, as stressors associated with travel and social interaction are not exclusive to such outings. Despite the limited research, a few studies have provided insights into the correlation between mental health and trips to the grocery store, independent of pandemic-related influences.

For instance, a study surveyed 239 volunteers across 29 focus groups, exploring stress in the context of grocery shopping. Participants expressed stress related to time pressure, crowd density, employee attitudes, store layout, as well as environmental factors such as music and lighting, and product availability [@aylottExploratoryStudyGrocery1998]. No quantitative data were gathered and stress was not measured before or after spending time grocery shopping - these were just stresses that participants expressed experiencing while grocery shopping. While this study is from 1998, it sheds light on the stress experienced in the context of grocery shopping and shows that this stress has existed even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

As previously mentioned, time pressure experienced at grocery stores can induce stress. In one study, 1,023 participants responded to a questionnaire about grocery shopping and shopping satisfaction, specifically addressing how shopping satisfaction related to time pressure. Researchers found that time pressure had varying effects on satisfaction depending on whether it was a major shopping trip or a fill-in shopping trip. They found that overall, women were less satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure and men were satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure. Overall, time pressure had a negative impact on shopping satisfaction, although other factors also influenced customer experiences [@nilssonEffectsTimePressure2017].

Overall, the literature does not strongly support the notion that time spent in grocery stores negatively impacts mental health and well-being.

### Libraries


Libraries serve as indispensable community resources, providing access to information, educational materials, and spaces for learning and social interaction. Beyond their traditional roles, libraries have increasingly been acknowledged for their potential to positively impact mental health and well-being. This section seeks to explore the diverse ways in which libraries can influence mental health outcomes.

Existing literature strongly supports the notion that libraries promote positive mental health and well-being. One literature review highlights the mental health support offered by many libraries, noting the comforting atmosphere provided to patrons, often attributed to the supportive library staff [@eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019]. Similarly, another study describes public libraries as offering a therapeutic landscape that is welcoming, comforting, calming, empowering, and overall conducive to well-being [@brewsterPublicLibraryTherapeutic2014].

Moreover, libraries often offer specialized programs and services aimed at promoting mental health and well-being. For instance, they may host mental health workshops, employ social workers, or introduce therapy dog programs to provide emotional support and coping strategies for patrons facing mental health challenges [@eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019].

Some libraries even have employees trained in bibliotherapy, a therapeutic approach that utilizes books and literature to support mental health outcomes. A systematic literature review synthesized evidence on bibliotherapy services at public libraries, revealing its effectiveness in aiding individuals with anxiety, stress, depression, and other issues [@zanalabidinSystematicLiteratureReview2023]. This coupling of access to literature with trained bibliotherapy professionals enhances mental health outcomes for library patrons.

Furthermore, programs like Get into Reading (GiR), which involve reading literature in group settings, have shown promise in reducing depressive symptoms. Participants in GiR sessions reported significant reductions in depressive symptoms, with certain genres facilitating relaxation and calming mental anxiety [@dowrickGetReadingIntervention2012].

In sum, libraries play a multifaceted role in promoting mental health and well-being through resource accessibility, community engagement, supportive environments, and specialized programs. Their positive impact on individuals' mental health outcomes is evident in the literature.

### Social Recreation

Social recreation spaces, including venues like restaurants, fast-food establishments, theaters, malls, and leisure spots, play a significant role in our society, providing opportunities for socialization, relaxation, and entertainment. Despite their pervasive presence, the impact of leisure time spent in these environments on mental health remains a topic of interest. This section analyzes the effects of social recreation spaces on mental health outcomes, drawing insights from recent research.

Leisure activities, those chosen when individuals have no work, familial, or societal obligations, have been shown to enhance well-being by eliciting positive emotions, thereby fostering effective long-term stress-coping mechanisms [@takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022]. Moreover, longitudinal studies have corroborated the positive association between leisure satisfaction and well-being over time [@kuykendallLeisureEngagementSubjective2015]. However, the nature of social interactions within these spaces can exert varying influences on individuals' well-being.

In a study analyzing the impact of negative and supportive social interactions on the quality of life of individuals with serious mental health conditions, researchers found distinct effects based on the type of social interactions. Negative interactions were significantly linked to lower quality of life, while supportive interactions corresponded with higher reported quality of life, primarily in subjective domains [@yanosNegativeSupportiveSocial2001]. This underscores the pivotal role of social interaction dynamics in shaping well-being.

Moreover, limited research exists on the impact of social deprivation or isolation on adolescents and adults. While self-reported loneliness has been linked to mental health issues, disentangling the causal relationship between loneliness and mental well-being remains challenging since it is unclear whether loneliness results in poor mental health or vice versa. Experimental studies on human loneliness face hurdles, as it is not solely a consequence of objective social deprivation, with some individuals feeling lonely even in crowded environments [@orbenEffectsSocialDeprivation2020].

Social recreation spaces have a multifaceted influence on mental health outcomes, offering platforms for social interaction and stress alleviation while harboring potential risk factors contingent upon the nature of these interactions. The intricate interplay between activities in these environments and mental well-being suggests that visits to social recreation locations may either bolster or diminish overall well-being, contingent upon the nature of social interactions experienced therein.

## Group Status

Navigating the intersection between mental health and travel behaviors unveils a complex interplay that significantly influences individuals' daily lives. In this section, we delve into the relationship between specific mental health conditions—autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and social anxiety—and their corresponding impacts on travel behaviors and overall well-being. Through recent research findings, we explore how individuals with autism and social anxiety navigate transportation challenges, revealing unique patterns that shape their mobility and mental health outcomes. By examining these nuanced connections, we aim to explore the profound implications of mental health conditions on travel behaviors.

### Autism

ASD, commonly referred to as autism, presents as a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition characterized by variations in social communication. Although typically diagnosed in early childhood, many features of autism may remain undetected until later stages of life [@ridgwaySubjectiveWellbeingAutistic]. Research comparing the well-being of autistic and non-autistic individuals highlights significant disparities, with autistic individuals often exhibiting lower levels of well-being, particularly evident among college students who grapple with challenges in social connectivity and balancing academic demands [@ridgwaySubjectiveWellbeingAutistic; @baileyRelationshipSocialExperience2020]. 

Despite its prevalence in many fields, autism remains relatively underexplored in transportation literature, with existing surveys failing to categorize individuals with autism. Recent studies have begun to address this gap, shedding light on the travel behaviors and experiences of autistic individuals. Surveys conducted among autistic adults in New Jersey underscored their reliance on others for transportation, often resulting in missed opportunities due to unavailable rides. Moreover, firsthand accounts from autistic individuals and their caregivers highlight feelings of isolation and depression stemming from transportation-related struggles [@dekaTravelPatternsNeeds2016; @lubinTransportationIssuesAdults2016]. 

These findings collectively suggest a potential link between lower well-being and distinct travel behaviors among autistic individuals, emphasizing the need for tailored support and inclusive transportation systems.


### Social Anxiety

Social anxiety involves an overwhelming fear of embarrassment or rejection from others and refers to the anxiety stemming from anticipated or real interpersonal judgement in social situations [@ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010; @yeSocialAnxietySubjective2021; @leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017]. These fears and anxieties tend to lead social anxious people to be more socially isolated than others [@ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010]. Frequently mistaken for shyness, social anxiety remains underrecognized, with a lifetime prevalence of 13% and a 12-month prevalence of 8% among adults and adolescents in the United States [@leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017].

Two studies examining the relationship between social anxiety and well-being found a negative correlation between the two variables. These studies looked at social anxiety experienced by participants, and not necessarily at participants who have social anxiety disorder, which is a persistent state of social anxiety that can cause major impacts or changes in one's daily life [@leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017]. In one study, @ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010 investigated the correlation between social anxiety and well-being among university students. They observed that higher levels of social anxiety were associated with lower overall well-being. Similarly, @yeSocialAnxietySubjective2021 found a significant negative correlation between social anxiety and well-being among Chinese college students.

When considering the impact of anxiety disorders on travel patterns, @rateringMovingAnxietyDisorder2024 studied the travel behaviors of 40 Dutch adults diagnosed with anxiety disorders. They noted that individuals with anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, often face mobility limitations due to anxiety-related concerns. Participants in the study used coping mechanisms such as traveling with familiar companions, avoiding certain locations, or staying at home altogether [@rateringMovingAnxietyDisorder2024].

Overall, heightened social anxiety is associated with reduced well-being and may prompt individuals to modify their travel behaviors, potentially resulting in fewer trips.

## Current State of the Research

Recently, a research group used mobile phone-based sensing to look at daily activities and environmental exposures and the connection to anxiety symptoms. @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 investigated the relationship between daily space-time activities, multiple environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The study utilized a cross-sectional mobile phone-based sensing approach to gather data. The goal was to understand how individuals' activities in different environmental settings contribute to their anxiety levels. The study collected data from participants using mobile phone sensors, including global position services (GPS) and accelerometers, to track their spatial movements and activity patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, multiple environmental exposures, such as air pollution, noise, and green space availability were assessed.

The findings of the study indicate that certain space-time activities and environmental exposures are associated with anxiety symptoms. Participants who spent more time in areas with higher levels of air pollution and noise reported higher anxiety levels. Conversely, spending time in green spaces was associated with lower anxiety symptoms. The study also found that physical activity and social interaction in various environments were linked to decreased anxiety.

The study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. In the referenced research, GPS data were collected over a 7-day period for each participant, and anxiety levels were assessed using a single questionnaire asking participants to reflect on the past two weeks. This study examined exposure to various areas traversed by individuals during their travel but did not determine where specific activities occurred. Moreover, the participants in the study were not categorized into particular groups.

To build upon this existing research, our study adopts a longitudinal approach, collecting location-based services (LBS) data from participants for periods ranging from **one month to one year, with an average duration of XXX months**. Participants were prompted to complete a mental health survey twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, allowing for more detailed and frequent assessments of mental health outcomes in relation to daily travel habits. Furthermore, our study identifies and analyzes specific semantic activities rather than merely tracking GPS trajectories. We ensured that the activities identified accurately reflect where an individual stopped and engaged in an activity. Additionally, participants were grouped based on psychological evaluations into categories of autism, social anxiety, and control. This unique longitudinal dataset enables us to analyze the travel behavior of individuals in different groups, examining their travel patterns and specific activity locations over an extended period. This approach aims to provide deeper insights into the connections between travel behavior and mental health across different population segments.
