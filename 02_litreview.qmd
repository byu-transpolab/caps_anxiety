# Literature Review

Mental health and well-being are complex issues influenced by a multitude of factors, including social, economic, and environmental elements. Addressing these determinants is essential for promoting individual well-being [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009] . Additionally, travel behavior has been recognized as a significant factor impacting social and mental health [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. In this review, we explore current research on the effects of the built and natural environments, social isolation, travel behavior, and activity locations on mental health and well-being. We also examine the well-being and travel behavior of individuals with autism and social anxiety. Ultimately, we integrate these factors to highlight how our research aims to fill an existing gap in the literature.

## Impacts of the Built and Natural Environment

In recent years, a growing body of research has explored the relationship between the built and natural environment and mental health. Several studies have explored the association between the built and natural environment and mental health [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018; @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018; @engemann2019; @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. The findings of these studies specifically investigate the association between the urban environment, green and blue spaces, and mental health.

In a study conducted in Brussels, Belgium, researchers investigated the association between the urban environment and mental health. The researchers found that exposure to noise pollution, air pollution, and lack of green space were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress. In contrast, living close to green space was associated with lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021]. In addition, in a systematic review of the literature on the relationship between the living environment and depressive mood by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, similar results were found and confirmed the study by @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021. In addition to the literature review by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, @engemann2019 conducted a study to investigate the relationship between residential green space in childhood and the risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood. The study found that individuals who grew up in areas with more residential green space had a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders. This may indicate that having access to green space as a child can affect one's mental health in the future.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to natural environments became more limited for many people due to lock downs and social distancing measures. A study found that contact with blue-green spaces during the pandemic lock down was beneficial for mental health. The study was conducted in Spain and surveyed individuals who had access to blue-green spaces, such as coastal areas or parks, during the lockdown. The results showed that those who had contact with these spaces reported lower levels of stress and anxiety than those who did not have access to blue-green spaces [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Similarly, additional research supports the idea that access to natural environments can contribute to positive mental health outcomes, independent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another study investigated the associations between green and blue spaces and mental health across 18 countries. The study found that individuals who had access to more green and blue spaces reported higher levels of mental health and well-being. Specifically, exposure to green spaces was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, while exposure to blue spaces was associated with improved mood and cognitive function [@whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. Access to green and blue spaces could serve as a coping strategy during stressful situations like pandemics.

The relationship between natural environments and positive mental health has been a topic of interest for researchers for decades as researchers have worked towards addressing the determinants of positive mental health. @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021 points out that poor mental health creates more of a challenge for those in high-income countries which may be a consequence of urbanization and lack of access to the natural environment.

Overall, the research suggests that access to and time spent exposed to natural environments can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. These findings have important implications for supporting positive mental health. Providing individuals with access to green and blue spaces can promote positive mental health outcomes, particularly during times of stress and adversity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Impacts of Social Isolation

Social isolation or social exclusion is affected by one's ability to travel which affects individuals' mental health. Researchers investigated the link between mobility, social exclusion, and well-being. The researchers conducted a survey among residents of Melbourne, Australia, to analyze the impact of social exclusion on well-being and how mobility can mediate this relationship. The study found that mobility can improve well-being and reduce social exclusion, which can have a positive impact on individual mental health [@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. Similarly, another study explored the influence of transport disadvantage and social exclusion on well-being. The researchers used data from a survey of individuals in Melbourne, Australia, to examine the relationship between transport disadvantage and well-being, as well as the relationship between social exclusion and well-being. The study found that both transport disadvantage and social exclusion can negatively affect well-being, with social exclusion having a stronger impact [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. The ability and choice to make trips affects well-being and mental health of individuals.

@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009 reviewed the determinants of positive mental health, emphasizing the importance of social support and social connectedness, a sense of control and autonomy, self-esteem, and meaning and purpose in life. She argues that mental health promotion should focus on building resilience, enhancing positive emotions, and developing skills and competencies to manage adversity. Many of those competencies are related to social interactions and avoiding social isolation [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009].

When looking specifically at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, @loadesRapidSystematicReview2020 focused on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of children and adolescents. The authors conducted a rapid systematic review of existing literature on the topic and found that social isolation and loneliness can have a negative impact on mental health, including increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Overall, these results suggest that social exclusion and isolation, transport disadvantage, and loneliness can negatively impact individual well-being and mental health. On the other hand, mobility and contact with others can have a positive impact on individual well-being. These findings highlight the importance of social support networks, access to transportation, and the need to address social exclusion and isolation to promote individual well-being and mental health.

## Impacts of Travel Behavior

Travel patterns have been acknowledged as a significant determinant affecting the social and mental well-being of individuals. The following discussion aims to explore the relationship between travel behavior and mental well-being outcomes by analyzing findings from four relevant studies.

@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022 conducted a study in the Bandung Metropolitan area to investigate the effect of travel satisfaction and activity-travel patterns of other household members on social and mental health. This model showed that those who stay at home to work or study tend to experience high travel satisfaction and in turn high social and mental health. This is because these people appreciate the time that they spend outside of the home, which results in an increase in their social and mental health. However, if people spent too much time at home studying or working, then they typically experienced lower mental health because they are unable to interact with others outside of the home. But when these people have the opportunity to leave the home to travel, they experience better travel satisfaction and in turn better social and mental health [@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022]. Similarly, another study investigated how travel affects emotional well-being and life satisfaction. The researchers pointed out that those who regularly traveled to work experienced less life satisfaction than those who worked from home. However, the study revealed a positive association between general travel and emotional well-being, indicating that travel experiences contribute to improved mood and overall life satisfaction [@frimanHowDoesTravel2017]. Based on the results from these studies, it seems that there may be certain amount of travel, that is not too much but is enough to support interactions, that results in good mental health.

When exploring the relationship between gender, mental health, and travel, @mackettGenderMentalHealth2022 conducted a comprehensive study. The study found that women tend to experience higher levels of mental health issues related to travel, such as anxiety and stress, due to various factors, including route finding, safety concerns, and interacting with others. In another study @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 explored the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. The study found that travel behavior, such as active travel (e.g., walking or cycling) and public transportation use, was associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced stress and improved well-being. @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 pointed at that the relationship between mental health and travel is complex and nuanced because mental health issues can affect one's ability to travel and travel can worsen mental health issues.

The reviewed studies highlight the significant influence of travel behavior on social and mental health outcomes. Factors such as travel satisfaction, activity-travel patterns of household members, and gender differences play crucial roles in shaping these outcomes. Positive travel experiences are associated with improved emotional well-being and life satisfaction. However, it is essential to consider the potential challenges and disparities faced by different genders in relation to mental health and travel.

## Impacts of Activity Types

Literature specific to activities occurring at green spaces, grocery stores, libraries, and social recreation locations will be discussed to understand the potential impact of the activity locations on individuals' mental health and overall well-being. @takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022 found that the types of the activities that people chose to engage in affects the extent of the positive emotion elicited by the activity.

### Green Spaces

The role of green spaces in fostering mental well-being has garnered increasing attention. Numerous studies have documented the beneficial effects of green spaces on mental health across various demographic groups and settings. This section aims to explore the effects of time spent in green spaces on mental health.

Firstly, exposure to nature has been consistently associated with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. For example, one study found that participants who took a 90-minute walk in a natural environment exhibited decreased activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with rumination and heightened risk for mental illness, compared to those who walked in an urban setting [@bratmanNatureExperienceReduces2015]. In addition in a meta-analysis where 25 different studies were reviewed, results suggest that natural environments may have have a direct positive influence on overall mental well-being, mostly based on self-reported emotions by the participants [@bowlerSystematicReviewEvidence2010]. In addition, researchers in another study pointed out that there was a significant negative relationship between higher green space concentration and salivary cortisol concentrations, which indicated that living in areas with higher percentages of green spaces is associated with lower stress [@roeGreenSpaceStress2013]. Some research also discusses the effects of the long-term exposure. For example, @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018 conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces and anxiety and depression in adults. The study found that exposure to green and blue spaces was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression in adults. In another study, researchers found that those who perceived that their neighborhood consisted of significant green space had 1.37 to 1.60 times higher odds of better physical and mental health, respectively, compared to those who had the lowest perceived greenness in their neighborhood [@sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008] . Time spent in green spaces is associated with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Moreover, green spaces facilitate social interaction and community cohesion, which are important determinants of mental well-being. In the study by @sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008, participants answered questions related to the close-knit nature of the community, how much people are willing to help each other in the neighborhood, and on how many days in the past month they engaged in informal social activities like waving, saying hello, or chatting with neighbors. When the social interaction and community cohesion factors were considered, they were associated with improved mental health and the relationship between perceived greenness and mental health remained significant [@sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008].

The relationship between green spaces and mental health is complex, multifaceted, and can be difficult to quantify, but overall that have been no recent studies suggesting the green spaces negatively impact mental health. Overall, exposure to green spaces has emerged as a promising approach for promoting mental health and well-being. The evidence suggests that green space exposure can mitigate stress, anxiety, and depression and foster social connections.

### Grocery Stores

Supermarkets and grocery stores are integral to modern life, serving as essential hubs for purchasing food and household necessities. However, the experience of shopping in these environments can influence individuals' mental well-being in various ways. This section aims to explore the effects of time spent in grocery stores on mental health.

The research on the effects of grocery store visits on mental health appears to be relatively scarce, presenting an opportunity for further exploration through the findings of this study. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was limited research into this area, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many more studies related to mental health outcomes related to grocery stores likely due to the general increase in stress associated with travel and social interaction during the pandemic. Consequently, many studies on this topic emerged as a result of the pandemic. However, for the purpose of this thesis, discussions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the context of grocery store visits will be omitted, as these stressors are not exclusive to such outings. Only a small number of sources have provided insights into the correlation between mental health and trips to the grocery store, independent of pandemic-related influences.

One study surveyed 239 volunteers who were grouped in 29 focus groups. Group discussion moderators asked the volunteers to discuss stress in the context of grocery shopping. The participants expressed stress related to time pressure, crowd density, the attitude of the employees, the layout of the store, as well as music and lighting, and the availability of products [@aylottExploratoryStudyGrocery1998]. No quantitative data were gathered and stress was not measured before or after spending time grocery shopping - these were just stresses that participants expressed experiencing while grocery shopping. While this study is from 1998, it sheds light on the stress experienced in the context of grocery shopping and shows that this stress has existed even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

As described before, time pressure experienced at grocery stores can be stress inducing. In a study, 1023 participants answered a questionnaire about grocery stores and shopping satisfaction. The study specifically asked questions to gauge how shopping satisfaction related to time pressure. Researchers found that the time pressure had different effects on satisfaction based on if it was a major shopping shopping trip or a fill-in shopping trip. They found that overall, women were less satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure and men were satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure. Overall, time pressure had a negative effect, but there were other factors that affected the shopping satisfaction of the customer [@nilssonEffectsTimePressure2017].

Overall, the literature does not strongly support that time spent in grocery stores negative impacts mental health and well-being.

### Libraries

Libraries serve as vital community resources, offering access to information, educational materials, and spaces for learning and social interaction. Beyond their traditional roles, libraries have increasingly been recognized for their potential to positively influence mental health and well-being. This section aims to explore the diverse ways in which libraries can affect mental health outcomes.

The literature supports the conclusion that libraries promote positive mental health and well-being. One literature review points out that many libraries offer mental health support. In the review @eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019 points out that libraries provide a comforting atmosphere for patrons often thanks to the the supportive library staff. Another study describes public libraries as offering a therapeutic landscape that is welcoming, comforting, calming, empowering and overall conducive to overall well-being [@brewsterPublicLibraryTherapeutic2014].

Many libraries even offer specialized programs and services aimed at promoting mental health and well-being. For example, libraries may host mental health workshops, hire social workers, or have therapy dog programs to provide emotional support and coping strategies for patrons experiencing mental health challenges [@eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019].

Some libraries have employees trained in bibliotherapy which is a therapeutic approach that uses books and other forms of literature to support mental health outcomes. a systematic literature reviewed synthesized evidence about current bibliotherapy service at public libraries. The researchers found that many studies show that bibliotherapy has helped peopled with anxiety, stress, depression, and other issues [@zanalabidinSystematicLiteratureReview2023]. As libraries provide a space for individuals to have access to books and other literature, coupling this with employees trained in bibliotherapy can help improve mental health outcomes.

Another study looked at a program called Get into Reading (GiR) which involves reading literature in a group setting. In the study, participants answered questions to assess their depression before and after the GiR experience. Significant evidence suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms for those who participated in the GiR session. Researchers pointed out that certain genres lead to both observed and self-reported outcomes of relaxation, or calming of mental anxiety [@dowrickGetReadingIntervention2012].

Libraries play a multifaceted role in promoting mental health and well-being through access to resources, community engagement, supportive environments, and specialized programs. Libraries have a positive impact on individuals' mental health outcomes.

### Social Recreation

Social recreation spaces, including restaurants, fast-food establishments, theaters, malls, and other leisure venues, play a significant role in modern society, offering opportunities for socialization, relaxation, and entertainment. The impact of spending time in these environments on mental health remains a topic of interest. This section aims to examine the effects of spending time in social recreation spaces on mental health outcomes, drawing from recent research.

Leisure activities are activities that people choose to participate in when do not have any work, familial, or societal obligations. Research has shown that engaging in leisure activities can enhance well-being by evoking positive emotions, which fosters effective long-term stress-coping mechanisms [@takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022]. @kuykendallLeisureEngagementSubjective2015 found that leisure satisfaction was found to have a positive longitudinal relation with well-being, supporting the idea that leisure satisfaction positively influences well-being over time. While leisure in social recreation spaces may positive influence well-being, the type of social interactions may have an impact on well-being of individuals.

In a study by @yanosNegativeSupportiveSocial2001 that analyzed the impact of negative and supportive social interactions on the quality of life of individuals with servious mental health conditions, researchers found that there were different impacts based on the type of social interactions. In situations with negative social interactions, these interactions were significantly related to lower quality of life, as reported by the individual. Conversely, in supportive social interaction situations, individuals reported higher quality of life. Quality of life was reported in various subjective and objective domains, and the differences were mainly seen in the subjective domains as reported by the individuals [@yanosNegativeSupportiveSocial2001]. This suggests that the type of social interaction is an important determining factor in effect on quality of life and overall well-being.

In their research, @orbenEffectsSocialDeprivation2020 pointed out that limited research exists regarding the impact of social deprivation or isolation on both adolescents and adults. While some studies have looked into human loneliness, linking self-reported loneliness to mental health issues, the causal relationship between loneliness and mental well-being remains unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether loneliness results in poor mental health or vice versa. Additionally, studying human loneliness experimentally presents challenges as it is not solely a consequence of objective social deprivation; individuals may feel lonely in the absence of others or even in a crowd [@orbenEffectsSocialDeprivation2020].

Social recreation spaces play a multifaceted role in shaping mental health outcomes, offering opportunities for social interaction and stress reduction, but also presenting potential risk factors dependent on the nature of the interactions. The complex interplay between activities that occur in these environments and mental well-being suggests that activities to social recreation locations may or may not improve overall well-being.

## Group Status

### Autism

Autism spectrum disorder (referred to as autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition that persists throughout one's life and is often defined by variations in social communication. Autism is often identified and diagnosed in early childhood, however many characteristics of autism can remain unrecognized until later in life.[@ridgwaySubjectiveWellbeingAutistic].

In a study comparing well-being in 53 autistic and 49 non-autistic adolescents and young adults, @ridgwaySubjectiveWellbeingAutistic found that significantly lower well-being was found in the autistic group compared to the non-autistic group, suggesting autistic individuals may be more vulnerable to lower well-being. When specifically exmaining the well-being of autistic college students, researchers found that autistic students with lower well-being more often discussed challenges to make social connections and to balance their social and academic lives [@baileyRelationshipSocialExperience2020].

While autism is studied often in many fields, autism does not appear often in transportation literature. The National Household Travel Survey and other metropolitan travel surveys do not classify individuals with autism, so little is known about the travel behavior of autistic individuals.

In a recent study, researchers distributed a survey to 703 autistic adults in New Jersey to learn about their travel patterns [@dekaTravelPatternsNeeds2016]. The goal of the survey was to learn about travel patterns, needs, and barriers faced by autistic individuals. @dekaTravelPatternsNeeds2016 found that due to difficulties driving, walking, or taking transit, it is more common for autistic individuals to take rides from others, like parents, family members, or friends. The survey showed that due to the dependence on others, many autistic individuals forgo trips due to the unavailablity of others to provide rides. In another study, with a group of 22 autistic individuals and 19 parents or guardians, several of the autistic individuals expressed feeling isolated and experiencing bouts of depression due to transportation related struggles [@lubinTransportationIssuesAdults2016].

These studies suggest that the well-being of autistic individuals may be lower on average than the well-being of non-autistic individuals and that their travel behaviors differ. Autistic individuals may take less trips since they often rely on other for transport and many individuals reported feeling isolated or depressed because of transportation related difficulties.

### Social Anxiety

Social anxiety involves an overwhelming fear of embarrassment or rejection from others [@ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010]. Social anxiety also refers to the anxiety stemming from anticipated or real interpersonal judgement in social situations, whether real or imagined [@yeSocialAnxietySubjective2021; @leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017]. These fears and anxieties tend to lead social anxious people to be more socially isolated than others [@ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010]. Since social anxiety is often mistaken for shyness, it remains unrecognized and has a lifetime prevelance of 13% and a 12-month prevelanve of 8% among adults and adolescents in the United States [@leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017].

Two studies discussed the realtionship between social anxiety and well-being. These studies looked at social anxiety experienced by participants, and not necessarily at participants who have social anxiety disorder, which is a persistance state of social anxiety that can cause major impacts or changes in one's daily life [@leichsenringfalkSocialAnxietyDisorder2017]. In their study @ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010 sought to see if there is any correlation between univeristy students' social anxiety and well-being. They found a negative correaltion between social anxiety and well-being; as students experienced greater levels of social anxiety, their overall well-being decreased. In the other study, @yeSocialAnxietySubjective2021 found that among Chinese college students there was also a significant negative correlation between social anxiety and well-being.

When looking at how anxiety disorders affects travel patterns, @rateringMovingAnxietyDisorder2024 analyzed the travel of 40 Dutch adults who were officially diagnosed with anxiety disorders, not necessarily just social anxiety. They pointed out that individuals with anxiety disorders may face significant limitations in their mobility due to concerns about anxiety attacks which often leads to social isolation. Participants in the study participated in interviews and answered questions about their travel patterns and mobility. Researchers found that due the struggles the participants faced, many coped with their anxiety by traveling with someone they know, staying in familiar environments, avoiding specific locations, or just staying home all together [@rateringMovingAnxietyDisorder2024].

Overall, as social anxiety increases for individuals, their reported well-being decreases. In addition, individuals with anxiety disorders often cope with their anxieties by altering their travel behavior which may lead to them making less trips.

## Current State of the Research

Recently, a research group used mobile phone-based sensing to look at daily activities and environmental exposures and the connection to anxiety symptoms. @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 investigated the relationship between daily space-time activities, multiple environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The study utilized a cross-sectional mobile phone-based sensing approach to gather data. The goal was to understand how individuals' activities in different environmental settings contribute to their anxiety levels. The study collected data from participants using mobile phone sensors, including global position services (GPS) and accelerometers, to track their spatial movements and activity patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, multiple environmental exposures, such as air pollution, noise, and green space availability were assessed.

The findings of the study indicate that certain space-time activities and environmental exposures are associated with anxiety symptoms. Participants who spent more time in areas with higher levels of air pollution and noise reported higher anxiety levels. Conversely, spending time in green spaces was associated with lower anxiety symptoms. The study also found that physical activity and social interaction in various environments were linked to decreased anxiety.

The study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. In the referenced research, GPS data were collected over a 7-day period for each participant, and anxiety levels were assessed using a single questionnaire asking participants to reflect on the past two weeks. This study examined exposure to various areas traversed by individuals during their travel but did not determine where specific activities occurred. Moreover, the participants in the study were not categorized into particular groups.

To build upon this existing research, our study adopts a longitudinal approach, collecting location-based services (LBS) data from participants for periods ranging from **one month to one year, with an average duration of XXX months**. Participants were prompted to complete a mental health survey twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, allowing for more detailed and frequent assessments of mental health outcomes in relation to daily travel habits. Furthermore, our study identifies and analyzes specific semantic activities rather than merely tracking GPS trajectories. We ensured that the activities identified accurately reflect where an individual stopped and engaged in an activity. Additionally, participants were grouped based on psychological evaluations into categories of autism, social anxiety, and control. This unique longitudinal dataset enables us to analyze the travel behavior of individuals in different groups, examining their travel patterns and specific activity locations over an extended period. This approach aims to provide deeper insights into the connections between travel behavior and mental health across different population segments.
