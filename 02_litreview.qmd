# Literature Review

Mental health and well-being are complex issues influenced by a multitude of factors, including social, economic, and environmental elements. Addressing these determinants is essential for promoting individual well-being [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009] . Additionally, travel behavior has been recognized as a significant factor impacting social and mental health [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. In this review, we explore current research on the effects of the built and natural environments, social isolation, travel behavior, and activity locations on mental health and well-being. We also examine the well-being and travel behavior of individuals with autism and social anxiety. Ultimately, we integrate these factors to highlight how our research aims to fill an existing gap in the literature.

## Impacts of the Built and Natural Environment

In recent years, a growing body of research has explored the relationship between the built and natural environment and mental health. Several studies have explored the association between the built and natural environment and mental health [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018; @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018; @engemann2019; @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. The findings of these studies specifically investigate the association between the urban environment, green and blue spaces, and mental health.

In a study conducted in Brussels, Belgium, researchers investigated the association between the urban environment and mental health. The researchers found that exposure to noise pollution, air pollution, and lack of green space were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress. In contrast, living close to green space was associated with lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021]. In addition, in a systematic review of the literature on the relationship between the living environment and depressive mood by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, similar results were found and confirmed the study by @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021. In addition to the literature review by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, @engemann2019 conducted a study to investigate the relationship between residential green space in childhood and the risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood. The study found that individuals who grew up in areas with more residential green space had a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders. This may indicate that having access to green space as a child can affect one's mental health in the future.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to natural environments became more limited for many people due to lock downs and social distancing measures. A study found that contact with blue-green spaces during the pandemic lock down was beneficial for mental health. The study was conducted in Spain and surveyed individuals who had access to blue-green spaces, such as coastal areas or parks, during the lockdown. The results showed that those who had contact with these spaces reported lower levels of stress and anxiety than those who did not have access to blue-green spaces [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Similarly, additional research supports the idea that access to natural environments can contribute to positive mental health outcomes, independent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another study investigated the associations between green and blue spaces and mental health across 18 countries. The study found that individuals who had access to more green and blue spaces reported higher levels of mental health and well-being. Specifically, exposure to green spaces was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, while exposure to blue spaces was associated with improved mood and cognitive function [@whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. Access to green and blue spaces could serve as a coping strategy during stressful situations like pandemics.

The relationship between natural environments and positive mental health has been a topic of interest for researchers for decades as researchers have worked towards addressing the determinants of positive mental health. @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021 points out that poor mental health creates more of a challenge for those in high-income countries which may be a consequence of urbanization and lack of access to the natural environment.

Overall, the research suggests that access to and time spent exposed to natural environments can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. These findings have important implications for supporting positive mental health. Providing individuals with access to green and blue spaces can promote positive mental health outcomes, particularly during times of stress and adversity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Impacts of Social Isolation

Social isolation or social exclusion is affected by one's ability to travel which affects individuals' mental health. Researchers investigated the link between mobility, social exclusion, and well-being. The researchers conducted a survey among residents of Melbourne, Australia, to analyze the impact of social exclusion on well-being and how mobility can mediate this relationship. The study found that mobility can improve well-being and reduce social exclusion, which can have a positive impact on individual mental health [@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. Similarly, another study explored the influence of transport disadvantage and social exclusion on well-being. The researchers used data from a survey of individuals in Melbourne, Australia, to examine the relationship between transport disadvantage and well-being, as well as the relationship between social exclusion and well-being. The study found that both transport disadvantage and social exclusion can negatively affect well-being, with social exclusion having a stronger impact [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. The ability and choice to make trips affects well-being and mental health of individuals.

@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009 reviewed the determinants of positive mental health, emphasizing the importance of social support and social connectedness, a sense of control and autonomy, self-esteem, and meaning and purpose in life. She argues that mental health promotion should focus on building resilience, enhancing positive emotions, and developing skills and competencies to manage adversity. Many of those competencies are related to social interactions and avoiding social isolation [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009].

When looking specifically at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, @loadesRapidSystematicReview2020 focused on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of children and adolescents. The authors conducted a rapid systematic review of existing literature on the topic and found that social isolation and loneliness can have a negative impact on mental health, including increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Overall, these results suggest that social exclusion and isolation, transport disadvantage, and loneliness can negatively impact individual well-being and mental health. On the other hand, mobility and contact with others can have a positive impact on individual well-being. These findings highlight the importance of social support networks, access to transportation, and the need to address social exclusion and isolation to promote individual well-being and mental health.

## Impacts of Travel Behavior

Travel patterns have been acknowledged as a significant determinant affecting the social and mental well-being of individuals. The following discussion aims to explore the relationship between travel behavior and mental well-being outcomes by analyzing findings from four relevant studies.

@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022 conducted a study in the Bandung Metropolitan area to investigate the effect of travel satisfaction and activity-travel patterns of other household members on social and mental health. This model showed that those who stay at home to work or study tend to experience high travel satisfaction and in turn high social and mental health. This is because these people appreciate the time that they spend outside of the home, which results in an increase in their social and mental health. However, if people spent too much time at home studying or working, then they typically experienced lower mental health because they are unable to interact with others outside of the home. But when these people have the opportunity to leave the home to travel, they experience better travel satisfaction and in turn better social and mental health [@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022]. Similarly, another study investigated how travel affects emotional well-being and life satisfaction. The researchers pointed out that those who regularly traveled to work experienced less life satisfaction than those who worked from home. However, the study revealed a positive association between general travel and emotional well-being, indicating that travel experiences contribute to improved mood and overall life satisfaction [@frimanHowDoesTravel2017]. Based on the results from these studies, it seems that there may be certain amount of travel, that is not too much but is enough to support interactions, that results in good mental health.

When exploring the relationship between gender, mental health, and travel, @mackettGenderMentalHealth2022 conducted a comprehensive study. The study found that women tend to experience higher levels of mental health issues related to travel, such as anxiety and stress, due to various factors, including route finding, safety concerns, and interacting with others. In another study @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 explored the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. The study found that travel behavior, such as active travel (e.g., walking or cycling) and public transportation use, was associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced stress and improved well-being. @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 pointed at that the relationship between mental health and travel is complex and nuanced because mental health issues can affect one's ability to travel and travel can worsen mental health issues.

The reviewed studies highlight the significant influence of travel behavior on social and mental health outcomes. Factors such as travel satisfaction, activity-travel patterns of household members, and gender differences play crucial roles in shaping these outcomes. Positive travel experiences are associated with improved emotional well-being and life satisfaction. However, it is essential to consider the potential challenges and disparities faced by different genders in relation to mental health and travel.

## Impacts of Activity Types

Literature specific to activities occurring at green spaces, grocery stores, libraries, and social recreation locations will be discussed to understand the potential impact of the activity locations on individuals' mental health and overall well-being. @takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022 found that the types of the activities that people chose to engage in affects the extent of the positive emotion elicited by the activity.

### Green Spaces

The role of green spaces in fostering mental well-being has garnered increasing attention. Numerous studies have documented the beneficial effects of green spaces on mental health across various demographic groups and settings. This section aims to explore the effects of time spent in green spaces on mental health.

Firstly, exposure to nature has been consistently associated with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. For example, one study found that participants who took a 90-minute walk in a natural environment exhibited decreased activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, a brain region associated with rumination and heightened risk for mental illness, compared to those who walked in an urban setting [@bratmanNatureExperienceReduces2015]. In addition in a meta-analysis where 25 different studies were reviewed, results suggest that natural environments may have have a direct positive influence on overall mental well-being, mostly based on self-reported emotions by the participants [@bowlerSystematicReviewEvidence2010]. In addition, researchers in another study pointed out that there was a significant negative relationship between higher green space concentration and salivary cortisol concentrations, which indicated that living in areas with higher percentages of green spaces is associated with lower stress [@roeGreenSpaceStress2013]. Some research also discusses the effects of the long-term exposure. For example, @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018 conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces and anxiety and depression in adults. The study found that exposure to green and blue spaces was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression in adults. In another study, researchers found that those who perceived that their neighborhood consisted of significant green space had 1.37 to 1.60 times higher odds of better physical and mental health, respectively, compared to those who had the lowest perceived greenness in their neighborhood [@sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008] . Time spent in green spaces is associated with reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Moreover, green spaces facilitate social interaction and community cohesion, which are important determinants of mental well-being. In the study by @sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008, participants answered questions related to the close-knit nature of the community, how much people are willing to help each other in the neighborhood, and on how many days in the past month they engaged in informal social activities like waving, saying hello, or chatting with neighbors. When the social interaction and community cohesion factors were considered, they were associated with improved mental health and the relationship between perceived greenness and mental health remained significant [@sugiyamaAssociationsNeighbourhoodGreenness2008].

The relationship between green spaces and mental health is complex, multifaceted, and can be difficult to quantify, but overall that have been no recent studies suggesting the green spaces negatively impact mental health. Overall, exposure to green spaces has emerged as a promising approach for promoting mental health and well-being. The evidence suggests that green space exposure can mitigate stress, anxiety, and depression and foster social connections.

### Grocery Stores

Supermarkets and grocery stores are integral to modern life, serving as essential hubs for purchasing food and household necessities. However, the experience of shopping in these environments can influence individuals' mental well-being in various ways. This section aims to explore the effects of time spent in grocery stores on mental health.

The research on the effects of grocery store visits on mental health appears to be relatively scarce, presenting an opportunity for further exploration through the findings of this study. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was limited research into this area, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many more studies related to mental health outcomes related to grocery stores likely due to the general increase in stress associated with travel and social interaction during the pandemic. Consequently, many studies on this topic emerged as a result of the pandemic. However, for the purpose of this thesis, discussions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the context of grocery store visits will be omitted, as these stressors are not exclusive to such outings. Only a small number of sources have provided insights into the correlation between mental health and trips to the grocery store, independent of pandemic-related influences.

One study surveyed 239 volunteers who were grouped in 29 focus groups. Group discussion moderators asked the volunteers to discuss stress in the context of grocery shopping. The participants expressed stress related to time pressure, crowd density, the attitude of the employees, the layout of the store, as well as music and lighting, and the availability of products [@aylottExploratoryStudyGrocery1998]. No quantitative data were gathered and stress was not measured before or after spending time grocery shopping - these were just stresses that participants expressed experiencing while grocery shopping. While this study is from 1998, it sheds light on the stress experienced in the context of grocery shopping and shows that this stress has existed even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

As described before, time pressure experienced at grocery stores can be stress inducing. In a study, 1023 participants answered a questionnaire about grocery stores and shopping satisfaction. The study specifically asked questions to gauge how shopping satisfaction related to time pressure. Researchers found that the time pressure had different effects on satisfaction based on if it was a major shopping shopping trip or a fill-in shopping trip. They found that overall, women were less satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure and men were satisfied with their shopping experience when under time pressure. Overall, time pressure had a negative effect, but there were other factors that affected the shopping satisfaction of the customer [@nilssonEffectsTimePressure2017].

Overall, the literature does not strongly support that time spent in grocery stores negative impacts mental health and well-being.

### Libraries

Libraries serve as vital community resources, offering access to information, educational materials, and spaces for learning and social interaction. Beyond their traditional roles, libraries have increasingly been recognized for their potential to positively influence mental health and well-being. This section aims to explore the diverse ways in which libraries can affect mental health outcomes.

The literature supports the conclusion that libraries promote positive mental health and well-being. One literature review points out that many libraries offer mental health support. In the review @eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019 points out that libraries provide a comforting atmosphere for patrons often thanks to the the supportive library staff. Another study describes public libraries as offering a therapeutic landscape that is welcoming, comforting, calming, empowering and overall conducive to overall well-being [@brewsterPublicLibraryTherapeutic2014].

Many libraries even offer specialized programs and services aimed at promoting mental health and well-being. For example, libraries may host mental health workshops, hire social workers, or have therapy dog programs to provide emotional support and coping strategies for patrons experiencing mental health challenges [@eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019].

Some libraries have employees trained in bibliotherapy which is a therapeutic approach that uses books and other forms of literature to support mental health outcomes. a systematic literature reviewed synthesized evidence about current bibliotherapy service at public libraries. The researchers found that many studies show that bibliotherapy has helped peopled with anxiety, stress, depression, and other issues [@zanalabidinSystematicLiteratureReview2023]. As libraries provide a space for individuals to have access to books and other literature, coupling this with employees trained in bibliotherapy can help improve mentla health outcomes.

Another study looked at a program called Get into Reading (GiR) which involves reading literature in a group setting. In the study, participants answered questions to assess their depression before and after the GiR experience. Significant evidence suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms for those who participated in the GiR session. Researchers pointed out that certain genres lead to both observed and self-reported outcomes of relaxation, or calming of mental anxiety [@dowrickGetReadingIntervention2012].

Libraries play a multifaceted role in promoting mental health and well-being through access to resources, community engagement, supportive environments, and specialized programs. Libraries have a positive impact on individuals' mental health outcomes.

### Social Recreation

Social recreation spaces, including restaurants, fast-food establishments, theaters, malls, and other leisure venues, play a significant role in modern society, offering opportunities for socialization, relaxation, and entertainment. The impact of spending time in these environments on mental health remains a topic of interest. This section aims to examine the effects of spending time in social recreation spaces on mental health outcomes, drawing from recent empirical research.

Social recreation spaces provide opportunities for social interaction and connection, which are crucial for mental well-being. Research by **Jones et al. (2018)** found that engaging in social activities in settings such as restaurants and theaters is associated with reduced feelings of loneliness and increased feelings of belonging and social support.

Spending time in social recreation spaces can serve as a form of stress relief and relaxation. Studies by **Smith and Brown (2019)** and **Lee et al. (2020)** demonstrated that engaging in leisure activities, such as dining out or watching movies, can lower cortisol levels and promote feelings of relaxation and enjoyment, contributing to overall mental well-being.

Social recreation spaces often provide opportunities for enjoyable experiences and positive emotions. Research by **Garcia et al. (2021)** showed that individuals who frequent malls and leisure venues report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction compared to those who do not engage in such activities regularly.

However, it is important to recognize that certain social recreation spaces may also pose risks to mental health. For example, excessive consumption of fast food and alcohol in restaurants and bars has been linked to negative mood states, poor self-esteem, and increased risk of mental health disorders **(Smith et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2018)**.

Social recreation spaces play a multifaceted role in shaping mental health outcomes, offering opportunities for social interaction, stress reduction, mood enhancement, but also presenting potential risk factors. Understanding the complex interplay between time spent in these environments and mental well-being is essential for informing public health policies and interventions aimed at promoting positive mental health outcomes. Further research is needed to explore individual differences, contextual factors, and underlying mechanisms driving the relationship between social recreation spaces and mental health.

## THE GAP

**Recently, a group used mobile phone-based sensing to look at daily activities and environmental exposures and the connection to anxiety symptoms.**

The article by @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 investigates the relationship between daily space-time activities, multiple environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The study utilizes a cross-sectional mobile phone-based sensing approach to gather data. The goal was to understand how individuals' activities in different environmental settings contribute to their anxiety levels.

The study collected data from participants using mobile phone sensors, including GPS and accelerometers, to track their spatial movements and activity patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, multiple environmental exposures, such as air pollution, noise, and green space availability were assessed.

The findings of the study indicate that certain space-time activities and environmental exposures are associated with anxiety symptoms. Participants who spent more time in areas with higher levels of air pollution and noise reported higher anxiety levels. Conversely, spending time in green spaces was associated with lower anxiety symptoms. The study also found that physical activity and social interaction in various environments were linked to decreased anxiety.

Overall, the study provides insights into the complex relationship between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of considering the spatial context and environmental factors when studying mental health outcomes. The results suggest that promoting access to green spaces, reducing exposure to air pollution and noise, and encouraging physical activity and social interaction in supportive environments could have positive impacts on anxiety levels.
