Mental health and well-being are influenced by various factors, including social elements, environmental elements, and travel behavior [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009; @delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. Specifically, the relationship between travel behavior and mental health is complex and even incorporates social and environmental aspects. Various aspects of the relationship between mental health and travel behavior have been studied individually, including the negative effects of restricted mobility, the mixed impact of access to different amenities, the psychological burden of travel itself, and the specific travel behaviors of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and social anxiety. Understanding these intricate connections is essential to understanding how travel patterns and behaviors influence mental health.

Restricted travel and limited social interaction can negatively impact mental health, contributing to increased feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. Social isolation and loneliness are critical determinants of mental health, with substantial evidence linking them to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders [@loadesRapidSystematicReview2020]. The ability to travel and engage with others plays a vital role in mitigating these feelings. During significant periods of isolation, such as the COVID-19 lockdowns, the lack of social interactions highlighted the importance of mobility in maintaining mental well-being [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. Studies have indicated that social support networks and access to transportation are essential for fostering connections and enhancing overall mental health [@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011; @delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011]. Moreover, the impact of social deprivation and loneliness on mental health remains a nuanced challenge, as individuals may experience loneliness even in crowded environments [@orbenEffectsSocialDeprivation2020]. Overall, maintaining mobility and social connections is essential for mental well-being, as the ability to travel can help reduce feelings of isolation, though its impact depends on the environments and interactions individuals encounter.

While mobility plays a crucial role in reducing social isolation and supporting mental well-being, the specific environments people access through travel can have varying effects on their mental health. The relationship between the built and natural environments and mental health is multifaceted, with some amenities supporting mental health whereas other worsening mental health. Green and blue spaces, for instance, have been shown to alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression, enhancing mood and bolstering cognitive function thus making them vital for enhancing mental health and overall well-being [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021; @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018]. Similarly, libraries serve as essential community resources that not only provide access to information and educational materials but also foster a comforting atmosphere and therapeutic landscape that is welcoming, calming, empowering, and overall conducive to well-being [@eliaPublicLibrariesSupporting2019; @brewsterPublicLibraryTherapeutic2014]. On the other hand, grocery stores and social recreation spaces, such as restaurants and theaters, present a more complex picture. Grocery shopping can induce stress due to factors like time pressure and crowd density, which can negatively impact shopping satisfaction as well as overall mental well-being [@aylottExploratoryStudyGrocery1998; @nilssonEffectsTimePressure2017]. In contrast, social recreation spaces offer opportunities for socialization and relaxation, which can enhance well-being by eliciting positive emotions and fostering long-term stress-coping mechanisms [@takiguchiRelationshipLeisureActivities2022]. Researchers found a positive link between leisure satisfaction and well-being over time [@kuykendallLeisureEngagementSubjective2015]. However, the quality of social interactions in these environments is crucial; supportive interactions can lead to higher quality of life, while negative interactions can diminish well-being [@yanosNegativeSupportiveSocial2001]. This highlights the intricate interaction between built and natural environments and mental well-being, suggesting that visits to various amenities can either bolster or hinder overall mental health, depending on the nature of the interactions experienced. Understanding how different environments influence mental health underscores the importance of not only promoting mobility but also ensuring access to spaces that foster well-being while minimizing exposure to those that may contribute to stress and anxiety.

Beyond the destinations people visit and the amenities they acccess, the experience of travel itself plays a crucial role in shaping mental well-being, with factors such as travel satisfaction, commuting stress, and mobility patterns influencing overall mental health outcomes. Studies show that travel satisfaction significantly impacts social and mental health. For instance, a study by @syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022 found that individuals who reported higher travel satisfaction also experienced better mental health outcomes. However, while working or studying from home can enhance travel satisfaction, excessive time spent on obligatory activities may limit social interactions, negatively affecting mental health. Encouraging travel, even amid significant commitments, can foster better social connections and mental well-being [@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022]. Additionally, regular commuters often report lower life satisfaction compared to those who work from home, yet general travel experiences are associated with improved mood and overall life satisfaction. These insights underscore the importance of integrating travel into daily routines as a strategy to enhance mental health and well-being, emphasizing that positive travel experiences can lead to significant improvements in emotional health and quality of life [@frimanHowDoesTravel2017]. Since travel itself affects mental health, it is crucial to consider how travel experiences differ for individuals with specific cognitive or mental difference, such as those with ASD and social anxiety, who may face unique barriers to mobility and social engagement.

Individuals with ASD and those with social anxiety exhibit distinct travel behaviors that impact their daily lives and mental health. We use the term “autistic” as recommended by many self-advocates we know who prefer the identify-first label “autistic” over person-first terminology “individual with autism spectrum disorder (or condition)” [@kennyWhichTermsShould2016]. Autistic individuals often face challenges in social communication and may rely on others for transportation, leading to missed opportunities and feelings of isolation. Research indicates that they engage in fewer activities, which correlates with lower well-being [@baileyRelationshipSocialExperience2020; @ridgwaySubjectiveWellbeingAutistic; @dekaTravelPatternsNeeds2016; @lubinTransportationIssuesAdults2016]. Similarly, individuals with social anxiety experience significant fear of judgment, resulting in increased social isolation and mobility limitations. They may avoid certain locations or travel only with familiar companions, which can further reduce their activity engagement and decrease their overall well-being [@leichsenringSocialAnxietyDisorder2017; @ozturkRelationshipAttachmentStyle2010; @yeSocialAnxietySubjective2021; @rateringMovingAnxietyDisorder2024]. These distinct travel behaviors and patterns underscore how the unique mobility challenges faced by autistic individuals and those with social anxiety can significantly impact their mental health.

A recent research by @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 exemplifies efforts to connect travel behavior, environmental factors, and mental health outcomes by exploring the relationship between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms by using mobile phone-based sensing. By tracking spatial movements through GPS and accelerometers, the study found that time spent in areas with high air pollution and noise was linked to increased anxiety, while exposure to green spaces correlated with lower anxiety levels. This research, while valuable in providing insights into how the environment impacts mental health, was limited by its short duration—only tracking trips over a 7-day period. Additionally, it relied on self-reported recollection of trips and locations, rather than direct observation, which may have introduced biases or inaccuracies in the data. Nonetheless, this study represents an important step toward connecting various aspects of travel behavior and mental health, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and nuanced research to understand the full impact of travel on mental well-being.

Despite the growing body of research on how travel behavior, environmental factors, and mobility impact mental health, there remains a gap in understanding how these elements interact and impact individuals with specific mental health challenges, such as those with ASD and social anxiety. Of particular importance are two that we hope to address in this research. First, existing studies often fail to control for preexisting or baseline mental health and its impacts on travel behavior; do people with neurotypologies or stressors predisposing them to heightened anxiety or depression **make fewer trips** than others, thus reversing the causality in the observed relationships? Second, regardless of neurotypology or mental health baseline, previous studies have failed to address the direction of causality in a compelling way. What is needed is a long-term observation of mental health indicators alongside travel and activity data on which baselines can be measured and the directionality evaluated. By connecting these factors, we can begin to understand the diverse needs of individuals with unique cognitive and mental health challenges and develop more effective strategies to support their well-being.
