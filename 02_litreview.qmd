# Literature Review

**Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being and mental health is decreasing (as urbanization is increasing, as a result of COVID-19).**

Mental health is a complex issue that can be influenced by various factors, including social, economic, and environmental factors. Addressing the determinants of positive mental health is crucial in promoting well-being [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009]. The relationship between natural environments and positive mental health has been a topic of interest for researchers for decades and has worked towards addressing the determinants of positive mental health. Barry reviews the determinants of positive mental health, emphasizing the importance of social support and social connectedness, a sense of control and autonomy, self-esteem, and meaning and purpose in life. She argues that mental health promotion should focus on building resilience, enhancing positive emotions, and developing skills and competencies to manage adversity [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009]. @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021 adds that poor mental health creates more of a challenge for those in high-income countries which may be a consequence of urbanization and lack of natural environment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to natural environments became more limited for many people due to lock downs and social distancing measures. However, a study conducted by @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021 found that contact with blue-green spaces during the pandemic lock down was beneficial for mental health. The study was conducted in Spain and surveyed individuals who had access to blue-green spaces, such as coastal areas or parks, during the lock down. The results showed that those who had contact with these spaces reported lower levels of stress and anxiety. Similarly, additional research supports the idea that access to natural environments can contribute to positive mental health outcomes, independent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A study conducted by @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021 investigated the associations between green and blue spaces and mental health across 18 countries. The study found that individuals who had access to more green and blue spaces reported higher levels of mental health and well-being. Specifically, exposure to green spaces was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, while exposure to blue spaces was associated with improved mood and cognitive function. Access to green and blue spaces could serve as a coping strategy during stressful situations like pandemics.

Overall, the research suggests that access to natural environments can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being. These findings have important implications for mental health promotion and urban planning. Providing individuals with access to green and blue spaces can promote positive mental health outcomes, particularly during times of stress and adversity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Social isolation or social exclusion is affected by one's ability to travel and in turn affects mental health.**

@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011 investigates the link between mobility, social exclusion, and well-being. The authors conducted a survey among residents of Melbourne, Australia, to analyze the impact of social exclusion on well-being and how mobility can mediate this relationship. The study found that mobility can improve well-being and reduce social exclusion, which can have a positive impact on individual mental health. Similarly, @delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011 explored the influence of transport disadvantage and social exclusion on well-being. The authors used data from a survey of individuals in Melbourne, Australia, to examine the relationship between transport disadvantage and well-being, as well as the relationship between social exclusion and well-being. The study found that both transport disadvantage and social exclusion can negatively affect well-being, with social exclusion having a stronger impact. The ability and choice to make trips affects well-being and mental health of individuals.

When looking specifically at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, @loadesRapidSystematicReview2020 , focused on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of children and adolescents. The authors conducted a rapid systematic review of existing literature on the topic and found that social isolation and loneliness can have a negative impact on mental health, including increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Overall, these articles suggest that social exclusion and isolation, transport disadvantage, and loneliness can negatively impact individual well-being and mental health. On the other hand, mobility and contact with others can have a positive impact on individual well-being. These findings highlight the importance of social support networks, access to transportation, and the need to address social exclusion and isolation to promote individual well-being and mental health.

**The environment in which people live and interact affects their mental health.** (built environment)

In recent years, a growing body of research has explored the relationship between the built environment and mental health. Several studies have explored the association between the built environment and mental health [@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018; @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018; @engemann2019; @hoisingtonTenQuestionsConcerning2019]. The findings of these studies specifically investigate the association between the urban environment, green and blue spaces, and mental health.

@pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021 conducted a study in Brussels, Belgium, to investigate the association between the urban environment and mental health. The study found that exposure to noise pollution, air pollution, and lack of green space were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and stress. In contrast, living close to green space was associated with lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms. Similarly, @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021 conducted a cross-country study in 18 countries to investigate the relationship between green and blue spaces and mental health. The study found that exposure to green and blue spaces was associated with better mental health outcomes, including lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, @pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021 investigated the impact of contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic lock down on mental health. The study found that individuals who had more contact with blue-green spaces reported better mental health outcomes, including lower levels of stress and anxiety.

@rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018 conducted a systematic review of the literature on the relationship between the living environment and depressive mood. The review found that several environmental factors, including noise pollution, air pollution, and lack of green space, were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. The review also found that access to green spaces, such as parks and gardens, was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. In addition to the literature review by @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018, @gasconLongtermExposureResidential2018 conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces and anxiety and depression in adults. The study found that exposure to green and blue spaces was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression in adults.

@engemann2019 conducted a study to investigate the relationship between residential green space in childhood and the risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood. The study found that individuals who grew up in areas with more residential green space had a lower risk of developing psychiatric disorders. This may indicate that having access to green space can affect one's mental health in the future.

Overall, the literature suggests that exposure to green and blue spaces is associated with better mental health outcomes, while exposure to noise and air pollution is associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. @hoisingtonTenQuestionsConcerning2019 reviewed the literature on the relationship between the built environment and mental health and identified ten questions concerning this relationship. Their review highlighted the need for further research to understand the complex interactions between the built environment and mental health outcomes.

**Types of activities or travel affect people's mental health differently.**

Travel behavior has been recognized as a significant factor influencing social and mental health among individuals. The following discussion aims to explore the relationship between travel behavior and mental well-being outcomes by analyzing findings from four relevant studies.

@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022 conducted a study in the Bandung Metropolitan area to investigate the effect of travel satisfaction and activity-travel patterns of other household members on social and mental health. This model showed that those who stay at home to work, or study tend to experience high travel satisfaction and in turn high social and mental health. These people appreciate the time that they spend outside of the home, which results in an increase in their social and mental health. However, if people spend too much time at home studying or working, then they typically experience lower mental health because they are unable to interact with others outside of the home. But when these people have the opportunity to leave the home to travel, they experience better travel satisfaction and in turn better social and mental health. Similarly, @frimanHowDoesTravel2017 investigated how travel affects emotional well-being and life satisfaction. They pointed out that those who regularly traveled to work experienced less life satisfaction than those who worked from home. However, the study revealed a positive association between travel and emotional well-being, indicating that travel experiences contribute to improved mood and overall life satisfaction.

When exploring the relationship between gender, mental health, and travel, @mackettGenderMentalHealth2022 conducted a comprehensive study. The study found that women tend to experience higher levels of mental health issues related to travel, such as anxiety and stress, due to various factors, including route finding, safety concerns, and interacting with others. In another study @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 explored the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. The study found that travel behavior, such as active travel (e.g., walking or cycling) and public transportation use, was associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced stress and improved well-being. @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021 pointed at that the "relationship between mental health and travel is complex" because mental health issues can affect one's ability to travel and travel can worsen mental health issues.

The reviewed studies highlight the significant influence of travel behavior on social and mental health outcomes. Factors such as travel satisfaction, activity-travel patterns of household members, and gender differences play crucial roles in shaping these outcomes. Positive travel experiences are associated with improved emotional well-being and life satisfaction. However, it is essential to consider the potential challenges and disparities faced by different genders in relation to mental health and travel.

**Recently, a group used mobile phone-based sensing to look at daily activities and environmental exposures and the connection to anxiety symptoms.**

The article by @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 investigates the relationship between daily space-time activities, multiple environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The study utilizes a cross-sectional mobile phone-based sensing approach to gather data. The goal was to understand how individuals' activities in different environmental settings contribute to their anxiety levels.

The study collected data from participants using mobile phone sensors, including GPS and accelerometers, to track their spatial movements and activity patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured using a standardized questionnaire. Additionally, multiple environmental exposures, such as air pollution, noise, and green space availability were assessed.

The findings of the study indicate that certain space-time activities and environmental exposures are associated with anxiety symptoms. Participants who spent more time in areas with higher levels of air pollution and noise reported higher anxiety levels. Conversely, spending time in green spaces was associated with lower anxiety symptoms. The study also found that physical activity and social interaction in various environments were linked to decreased anxiety.

Overall, the study provides insights into the complex relationship between daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of considering the spatial context and environmental factors when studying mental health outcomes. The results suggest that promoting access to green spaces, reducing exposure to air pollution and noise, and encouraging physical activity and social interaction in supportive environments could have positive impacts on anxiety levels.
