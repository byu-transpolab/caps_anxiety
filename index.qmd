# Introduction

## Purpose

In the United States, the prevalence of mental illnesses among adults, aged 18 or older, rose from 19.1% in 2018 to 22.8% in 2021 [@mackettMentalHealthTravel2021; @MentalHealthNumbers]. The essence of mental health extends far beyond the absence of illness, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions essential for holistic well-being. As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is "a state of well-being in which an individual realizes their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to contribute to their community" [@MentalHealthPAHO]. This holistic perspective highlights mental health's pervasive influence on personal relationships, work efficiency, and lifestyle choices, accentuating the need to examine its intersection with individual daily behaviors and choices.

Among these choices, the impact of where and how individuals allocate their time becomes particularly intriguing. How and where individuals allocate their time is intricately linked to their travel behavior, which encompass the patterns, decisions, and experiences that define how people move from one place to another. These behaviors include a variety of factors such as trip frequency and destination choices, decisions individuals make about their travel almost every day [@timmermansSpatialContextComplexity2003]. Understanding the impact of these travel patterns on mental well-being is crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions that promote positive mental health outcomes while avoiding behaviors detrimental to well-being.

Part of the increase in mental health problems come from factors that limit people's engagement with the world around them. These factors are related to how people travel, including how they access the natural environment and engage with other people. Positive mental health is coincided with people's ability to access to the natural environment. Recent researchers have underscored the therapeutic benefits on mental health of engaging with green and blue spaces, ranging from parks and forests to oceans and rivers, in alleviating stress and anxiety, enhancing mood, and bolstering cognitive function [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021]. Green and blue spaces help support good mental health, but these spaces, the very thing that can help with mental health issues, are often inaccessable. Urbanization, for example, magnifys the predicament by reducing access to these spaces, thereby impeding efforts to foster mental well-being. In addition, the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing measures during COVID-19 further exacerbated this issue by limiting many individuals' interactions with nature, which was one observed major shift in travel patterns [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021]. In addition, studies have emphasized the adverse impact of reduced travel activities resulting from social isolation on overall well-being, underscoring the need to delve deeper into the association between travel behavior and well-being [@delboscExploringRelativeInfluences2011; @stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. These examples are just a few aspects of daily life that impact mental health.

Unraveling the connection between individual travel patterns and mental well-being holds potential in supporting those grappling with mental health challenges. To explore this connection in a new way, we will gather location data alongside mental health indicators for individuals on the same day. Since the raw location-based services (LBS) data or global positioning services (GPS) data lacks the granularity required to discern specific activities, a transformation of this data into daily activity patterns and categorized activity types is essential. Once this transformation is achieved, the combination of daily activity patterns with mental health survey responses yields a comprehensive dataset. This dataset serves as a robust foundation for analyzing the nuanced interplay between mental well-being and travel behavior. By delving into this dataset, we aim to illuminate the relationship between various mental health parameters and individuals' daily activity engagement, thereby providing invaluable insights into overall mental wellness.

## Scope

There are many ways to transform location data into meaningful activities and one method is by using clustering algorithms. This thesis uses the DBSCAN-TE algorithm with optimized parameters for noise, time, and entropy [@macfarlaneClassifyingLocationPoints2024]. These optimized parameters enable the algorithm to determine the daily activities of participants accurately. Prior to applying the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, preprocessing steps were taken to clean and refine the raw LBS data, ensuring its quality and reliability. After implementing the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, subsequent analysis enabled the determination of activity counts at four distinct location types: parks, grocery stores, libraries, and social recreation spaces. By leveraging the DBCAN-TE clustering algorithm and longitudinal data collection methods, we established a robust framework for investigating the interplay between individual travel patterns and mental health outcomes.

The data for this research come from a longitudinal study involving 88 volunteers from Utah County, Utah. Each participant identifies with one of three groups—control, social anxiety, or autism—based on a psychological evaluation. The data were collected by the Brigham Young University (BYU) Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) office using Metricwire Software and comprise both cellular LBS data and regular attitudinal survey responses. Survey questions encompassed various aspects of mental health, including stress levels, motivation, and thoughts of self-harm. The unique dataset, comprising LBS data and survey responses from diverse participant groups, provides a rich source of information to explore nuanced relationships and identify potential intervention strategies.

Through the development of statistical models and thorough data analysis, we aim to uncover key insights into how travel behavior influences motivation levels and mental health across different demographic groups. Specifically, the unique dataset and staticial models allow us delve into group-specific well-being and travel patterns, exploring variations across control, social anxiety, and autism groups. Additionally, we are set up to investigate the relationship between suicidality and motivation levels or travel behaviors within these groups. We also analyze the impact of engagement in activities at different location types on motivation levels. By illuminating these connections, our research aims to inform those with mental health challenges how their mental well-being influences their travel behavior. Ultimately, these are the foundational components of our research, emphasize the critical role of mental well-being in shaping travel behavior.

## Outline

This thesis will begin by exloring the existing literature on the relationship between mental health and travel behavior patterns, as well as the characteristics of the different groups represented in the CAPS dataset. It will then detail the methods used to identify the activities of the 88 participants, using a scoring algorithm and the DBSCAN-TE algorithm with previously optimized parameters [@macfarlaneClassifyingLocationPoints2024]. Once the activities are identified, the survey responses will be integrated to create a comprehensive and robust dataset. Following this, the thesis will focus on the creation and analysis of models to illuminate the relationship between mental health and individual travel behavior. A subsequent section will discuss the travel patterns and mental health outcomes of individuals from the different groups, highlighting the connection between activity engagement and well-being. The conclusion will offer suggestions for future research, reflect on the study's limitations, and summarize the key findings.Introduction.
