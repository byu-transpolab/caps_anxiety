# Introduction

In the United States, the prevalence of mental illnesses among adults, aged 18 or older, rose from 19.1% in 2018 to 22.8% in 2021 [@mackettMentalHealthTravel2021; @MentalHealthNumbers2023]. The essence of mental health extends far beyond the absence of illness, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions essential for holistic well-being. This holistic perspective highlights mental health's pervasive influence on personal relationships, work efficiency, and lifestyle choices, accentuating the need to examine its intersection with individual daily behaviors and choices. Among these behaviors and choices, the impact of where and how individuals allocate their time becomes particularly intriguing. How and where individuals allocate their time is intricately linked to their travel behavior, which encompass the patterns, decisions, and experiences that define how people move from one place to another. These behaviors include a variety of factors such as trip frequency and destination choices, decisions individuals make about their travel almost every day [@timmermansSpatialContextComplexity2003]. Understanding the impact of these travel patterns on mental well-being is potentially crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions that promote positive mental health outcomes while avoiding behaviors detrimental to well-being.

In this paper, through statistical modeling and comprehensive data analysis, we aim to uncover insights into how travel behavior impacts motivation levels and mental health across different neurological or phsyological groups. Our research allows inspection of group-specific well-being and travel patterns, exploring variations across control, social anxiety, and autism groups. Significant differences in activity engagement and motivation among individuals with autism, social anxiety, and the control group underscore the complex interplay between these factors and mental health. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between suicidality, motivation levels, and travel behaviors within these groups, as well as the impact of engagement in activities at different location types on motivation levels. Unraveling the connection between individual travel patterns and mental well-being holds potential in supporting those grappling with mental health challenges. By investigating into this dataset, we aim to illuminate the relationship between various mental health parameters and individuals' daily activity engagement, thereby providing invaluable insights into overall mental wellness.

This thesis explores the connection between mental health and travel behavior patterns currently discussed in the literature. It outlines the methods used to analyze activities and integrate survey responses into a cohesive dataset. Models are then presented to analyze the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. Following this, the discussion focuses on the travel patterns and mental health outcomes across different groups. Finally, the thesis concludes by offering insights for future research and summarizing the key findings.
