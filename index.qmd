# Introduction

Mental health is a critical global issue that profoundly impacts individuals' emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It extends far beyond the mere absence of illness, influencing personal relationships, work efficiency, and lifestyle choices. Understanding the complexities of mental health is essential, particularly as it intersects with individual daily behaviors and choices. Among these behaviors, the allocation of time and individualsâ€™ travel patterns are particularly intriguing, as they are intricately linked to mental well-being.

We need to better understand the relationship between travel behavior and mental health, specifically how travel behavior and daily activities affect individuals' mental well-being. Existing research has explored various factors influencing mental health, including built and natural environments, social isolation, and travel satisfaction. For instance, studies indicate that spending time in green spaces can enhance mental well-being and alleviate stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021; @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018]. Conversely, @loadesRapidSystematicReview2020 found that social isolation and loneliness negatively impact mental health, leading to increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, research has shown that increased mobility can improve well-being and reduce social exclusion, positively affecting mental health [@stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011]. In terms of travel satisfaction, studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between travel satisfaction and both social and mental health [@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022]. Notably, @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 began to explore the relationship between travel behavior and mental health using mobile phone-based sensing to investigate daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms.

Despite the existing literature, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how different travel behaviors and patterns specifically affect mental health across various populations. While some studies have examined the well-being of individuals with autism and social anxiety, comprehensive analyses that consider the nuances of travel behavior in relation to mental health outcomes are still lacking. This gap underscores the necessity for further investigation into how travel patterns influence mental health, particularly among those with different neurological or psychological typology such as autism and social anxiety.

In this research, we investigate the longitudinal mental health of a sample of college students, incorporating trip-making behavior from their mobile device location data. This allows us to track how often and where participants travel, providing a clearer picture of their daily activities and social interactions. By analyzing this data alongside survey responses about their mental health, we aim to identify patterns that link travel behavior to mental well-being. Our goal is to understand how different travel habits may affect mental health, particularly for autistic individuals or those with social anxiety. Ultimately, we hope our findings can help develop practical strategies and interventions that support students in improving their mental health through better travel and activity engagement.
