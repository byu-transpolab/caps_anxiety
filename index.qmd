# Introduction

Location-based services (LBS) data contain the spatial locations of many mobile
phone users, but they do not independently describe travel behavior [@du2007]. A 
classification of the LBS data from raw location points to semantic activities
is potentially desirable for many reasons, including removing error from travel diaries, 
making improving the quality of travel models, and providing insights into
traveler decision processes [@bohte2009;@usyukov2017]. 

The the most basic attempts at classifying activities relied on heuristic, rule-based
algorithms. 
Common heuristics include the implied speed between consecutive points, or the randomness of 
the direction between series of points [@deng2012].
It can be difficult for conclusive rules to be made, however: it is difficult 
to determine whether a person is moving slowly because they are waiting for a
traffic signal or because they are doing an activity. 
Decision trees can expand the number and types of rules that are applied [@lee2014],
potentially increasing the accuracy of the classification, but 
More advanced methods have been developed that rely on various 
machine learning algorithms [@xiao2016], but these can be difficult to deploy at 
smaller scales, or to develop when the data is not yet properly labeled.
An intermediate approach of density-based clustering algorithms [@duan2007; @luo2017;@gong2018] 
shows some promise for
particular applications where a neural network may be unwieldy or difficult to
train, but where classifying activities from location points is nonetheless
an important issue. But applying these methods requires estimating or asserting
particular parameters that may not be immediately intuitive.

In this research, we develop a method to evaluate the accuracy of activity locations
classified by a density-based spatial clustering with additional noise and time entropy
(DBSCAN-TE) algorithm. We calibrate the parameters of this algorithm by optimizing 
the error observed against manually-labeled activity locations.

The paper proceeds as follows. A Methodology section describes the DBSCAN-TE algorithm,
our error function, and the data we use in the calibration. A Results section describes
the outcomes of the calibration process, alongside an application of the calibrated
parameters to the larger, unlabeled data. A Conclusions section describes the
contributions and limitations of this work and proposes associated future research.
