# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Mental health is a critical global issue that profoundly impacts individuals' emotional, psychological, and social well-being [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009; @frimanHowDoesTravel2017; @hoisingtonTenQuestionsConcerning2019].
It extends far beyond the mere absence of illness, influencing personal relationships, work efficiency, and lifestyle choices [@barryAddressingDeterminantsPositive2009].
Understanding the complexities of mental health is essential, particularly as it intersects with individual daily behaviors and choices.
Among these behaviors, the allocation of time and individualsâ€™ travel patterns are particularly intriguing, as they are intricately linked to mental well-being [@frimanHowDoesTravel2017; @mackettMentalHealthTravel2021].

Previous research has explored many elements of the relationship between mental health and travel activity behavior patterns.
This previous research has largely focused on the positive mental health effects of time in green space [@pousoContactBluegreenSpaces2021; @whiteAssociationsGreenBlue2021; @pelgrimsAssociationUrbanEnvironment2021; @rautioLivingEnvironmentIts2018], as well as the deleterious effect of isolation [@loadesRapidSystematicReview2020; @stanleyMobilitySocialExclusion2011], or the negative effects of travel dissatisfaction [@syahputriEffectTravelSatisfaction2022].
Notably, @lanDailySpacetimeActivities2022 began to explore the relationship between travel behavior and mental health using mobile phone-based sensing to investigate daily activities, environmental exposures, and anxiety symptoms.

Despite the existing literature, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how different travel behaviors and patterns specifically affect mental health across various populations.
While some studies have examined the well-being of individuals with autism and social anxiety, comprehensive analyses that consider the nuances of travel behavior in relation to mental health outcomes are still lacking.
This gap underscores the necessity for further investigation into how travel patterns influence mental health, particularly among those with different neurological or psychological typology such as autism and social anxiety.

In this research, we investigate the longitudinal mental health of a sample of college students, incorporating trip-making behavior from their mobile device location data.
This allows us to track how often and where participants travel, providing a clearer picture of their daily activities and social interactions.
We pair this data with twice-daily survey responses concerning their mental health to identify patterns that link travel behavior to mental well-being.

The following section of the paper provides a [literature review](@sec-litreview) exploring the existing discussion around travel behavior and mental health.
A subsequent [methodology](@sec-methods) section describes our data assembly and curation process as well as the econometric framework we employ, followed by a [results](@sec-results) section presenting and discussing the econometric findings.
After discussing data and methodological [limitations](@sec-limitations), a final [concluding](@sec-conclude) section emphasizes the contribution of this research to a growing understanding of mental health and daily activities.
