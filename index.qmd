# Introduction

In the United States, the prevalence of mental illnesses among adults, aged 18 or older, rose from 19.1% in 2018 to 22.8% in 2021 [@mackettMentalHealthTravel2021; @MentalHealthNumbers2023]. The essence of mental health extends far beyond the absence of illness, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social dimensions essential for holistic well-being. This holistic perspective highlights mental health's pervasive influence on personal relationships, work efficiency, and lifestyle choices, accentuating the need to examine its intersection with individual daily behaviors and choices. The allocation of time and its impact is particularly intriguing, as it closely ties to travel behavior, including both patterns and decisions, related to moving from place to place. These behaviors include trip frequency, destination choices, and daily travel decisions [@timmermansSpatialContextComplexity2003]. Understanding the impact of these travel patterns on mental well-being is potentially crucial for empowering individuals to make informed decisions that promote positive mental health outcomes while avoiding behaviors detrimental to well-being.

In this thesis, through comprehensive data analysis and statistical modeling, we aim to uncover insights into how travel behavior impacts motivation levels and mental health across different neurological or psychological groups, exploring variations across autism, social anxiety, and control groups. Significant differences in activity engagement and motivation among individuals in the autism, social anxiety, and control groups underscore the complex interplay between these factors and mental health. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between suicidality, motivation levels, and travel behaviors within these groups. We also examine the impact of engagement in activities at different location types on motivation levels. By investigating this dataset, we aim to illuminate the relationship between various mental health parameters and individuals' daily activity engagement, thereby providing invaluable insights into overall mental wellness. Unraveling the connection between individual travel patterns and mental well-being holds potential in supporting those grappling with mental health challenges.

This thesis explores the connection between mental health and travel behavior patterns currently discussed in the literature. It outlines the methods used to analyze activities and integrate survey responses into a cohesive dataset. Models are then presented to analyze the relationship between mental health and travel behavior. Following this, the discussion focuses on the travel patterns and mental health outcomes across the three different groups. Finally, the thesis concludes summarizing the key findings and by offering insights for future research.
