# Conclusions {#sec-contribs}

Upon reviewing the output summaries of Model 1, Model 2, Model 3, Model 4, and Model 5, several insights emerge regarding the significance of covariates and the predictive performance of each model.

Model 1, which includes basic demographic variables such as age, sex, and intelligence quotient (IQ), reveals significant associations between the number of activities and sex, age, and to a lesser extent, IQ. Notably, being female and older are negatively associated with the number of activities, indicating that these demographic factors play a role in determining daily activity levels.

Expanding on Model 1, Model 2 incorporates additional information about neuro groups. Here, we observe significant associations between the number of activities and neuro groups and less association with age, suggesting that the neuro group may influence daily activity levels and that age does not contribute as much. Furthermore, the inclusion of neuro group information improves the model fit, as evidenced by the reduction in the log likelihood compared to Model 1.

Moving to Model 3, which includes data on suicidal ideation, we find that suicidal ideation does significantly impact the number of activities engaged in and neuro group variables remain significant predictor. It is interesting to note that age and sex both became less significant. This suggests that suicidal ideation and nuero group may significantly influence daily activity levels, whereas demographic factors may be less significant factors.

Model 4 introduces information about individualsâ€™ energy levels alongside demographics and neuro group. Interestingly, energy levels also emerge as significant predictors of the number of activities, indicating that physical energy levels play a crucial role in determining daily activity levels.

Finally, in Model 5, where Model 3 and Model 4 were essentially combined to include demographics, neuro group, suicidal ideation, and energy levels. The model results in both suicidal ideation and energy levels being significant predictors in the number of activities engaged in. Sex dropped out completely from significance.

In terms of overall predictive performance, Model 5 stands out as the most comprehensive and effective model. By incorporating a broader range of variables, including demographic, neuro group, mental health, and energy-related factors, Model 5 offers a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing daily activity levels. Additionally, the reduction in the log likelihood compared to previous models suggests that Model 5 provides the best fit to the observed data, indicating its predictive performance in capturing the variability in trip severity.

Overall, while each model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing daily activity levels, Model 5 emerges as the most robust and effective model in predicting the number of activities that participants engage in on a given day.

# Limitations and Future Considerations

There are some important limitations and future considerations following this initial analysis of the research.

## Limitations

As previously mentioned, there is concern that the average number of trips on a seven day rolling average will result in autocorrelation. This needs to be further analyzed. It is recommended that a form of fixed effects be applied to the regression analysis.

## Future Considerations

The impact of the location of the activities was going to be analyzed, but was not. I used Open Street Map data to create GeoJSON shapefiles for the locations of parks, grocery stores, libraries, and social-recreation in Utah County. I then overlaid the activity locations with the GeoJSON files to determine how many activities in each day occurred at those locations. It is recommended that this is further analyzed since the literature suggests that locations can influence mental health and overall mood. This analysis was not done for this project, but it is recommended that this be investigated in the future.
