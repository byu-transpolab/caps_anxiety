This is despite the increase in dual income families and longer working hours which are making general shopping a more stressful activity for many families because of time pressure and lack of response by retailers. This exploratory research confirms grocery shopping to be stressful, but time pressure was mentioned as only one factor causing shopping stress; other factors included: crowd density, staff attitude and training, store layout/relocation, impulse purchasing pressure, location, product assortment, music, and lighting. The article concludes by proposing a shopping stress curve for future examination.},

  abstract = {This mixed methods study examined the relationship between the college social experience and subjective well-being in autistic students in the Midwestern United States. An online survey focused on social connectedness, social participation, social support, and subjective well-being. A semi-structured interview discussed transition, supports received, and social participation. Correlations and a hierarchical regression were used to examine the relationship between social experience variables and subjective well-being from the survey. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify interview themes. Theme counts for students who reported higher and lower subjective well-being were examined. Social connectedness, time spent with friends, and perceived social support were positively correlated with students' subjective well-being, with social connectedness explaining unique variance. Common themes included challenges navigating a new social environment and the importance of family, friends, and professors in providing social support. Students with lower subjective well-being more frequently discussed struggles to make social connections and the trade-off between socializing and succeeding academically, whereas students with higher subjective well-being more frequently described college as providing opportunities to develop meaningful social connections. This study adds new perspectives on the college experience for autistic students and highlights the important role that social connections and support play in their subjective well-being.},

It works by emulating the physical process whereby a solid is slowly cooled so that when eventually its structure is "frozen," this happens at a minimum energy configuration. We restrict ourselves to the case of a cost function defined on a finite set. Extensions of simulated annealing to the case of functions defined on continuous sets have also been introduced in the literature (e.g., Geman and Hwang, 1986; Gidas, 1985a; Holley, Kusuoka and Stroock, 1989; Jeng and Woods, 1990; Kushner, 1985). Our goal in this review is to describe the method, its convergence and its behavior in applications.},

  abstract = {Urbanization has many benefits, but it also is associated with increased levels of mental illness, including depression. It has been suggested that decreased nature experience may help to explain the link between urbanization and mental illness. This suggestion is supported by a growing body of correlational and experimental evidence, which raises a further question: what mechanism(s) link decreased nature experience to the development of mental illness? One such mechanism might be the impact of nature exposure on rumination, a maladaptive pattern of self-referential thought that is associated with heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses. We show in healthy participants that a brief nature experience, a 90-min walk in a natural setting, decreases both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), whereas a 90-min walk in an urban setting has no such effects on self-reported rumination or neural activity. In other studies, the sgPFC has been associated with a self-focused behavioral withdrawal linked to rumination in both depressed and healthy individuals. This study reveals a pathway by which nature experience may improve mental well-being and suggests that accessible natural areas within urban contexts may be a critical resource for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

  abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has received a substantial amount of attention in other fields, very little appears in the transportation literature about people with ASD. Because the National Household Travel Survey and metropolitan travel surveys do not classify people with ASD as a separate category of persons with disabilities, very little information is available about their travel patterns, needs, or barriers. To bridge the existing information gap, this paper provides results from a recent survey that focused exclusively on adults with ASD in New Jersey to learn about their travel patterns, the importance of the various types of trips they make, and the barriers they encounter regarding the use of different transportation modes. The survey, distributed through various organizations throughout the state, was completed by or for 703 adults. Because the objective of the paper is to provide as much information as possible from the survey, no attempt has been made to compare the travel patterns, needs, and barriers of the survey respondents with those of the general population. However, other researchers can easily compare the survey results provided in this paper with data from other sources. Although the survey generated other valuable information, the most revealing information pertained to barriers to walking, driving, taking public transit, and even taking rides from others. The information collected through this research is being shared through outreach efforts with agencies that provide or fund transportation to persons with disabilities in New Jersey.},

Get into Reading is a shared reading intervention which has demonstrable acceptability and feasibility. This paper explores potential catalysts for change resulting from Get into Reading. Two weekly reading groups ran for 12 months, in a GP surgery and a mental health drop-in centre, for people with a GP diagnosis of depression and a validated severity measure. Data collection included quantitative measures at the outset and end of the study, digital recording of sessions, observation and reflective diaries. Qualitative data were analysed thematically and critically compared with digital recordings. The evidence suggested a reduction in depressive symptoms for Get into Reading group participants. Three potential catalysts for change were identified: literary form and content, including the balance between prose and poetry; group facilitation, including social awareness and communicative skills; and group processes, including reflective and syntactic mirroring. This study has generated hypotheses about potential change processes of Get into Reading groups. Evidence of clinical efficacy was limited by small sample size, participant attrition and lack of controls. The focus on depression limited the generalisability of findings to other clinical groups or in non-clinical settings. Further research is needed, including assessment of the social and economic impact and substantial trials of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.},

  abstract = {Given that death by suicide continues to rank among the top three causes of death during adolescence, new psychological models may contribute critical insight towards understanding the complex interactions between risk and protective factors in suicidal behaviour. The main objective of this study was to analyse the psychological network structure of suicidal behaviour and putative risk and protective factors in school-aged adolescents. Methods: Stratified random cluster sampling was performed. The final sample comprised 1790 students (53.7\% female, M = 15.7 years, SD = 1.26). Instruments were administered to assess suicidal behaviour, emotional and behavioural difficulties, prosocial behaviour, subjective well-being, self-esteem, depressive symptomatology, academic performance, socio-economic status, school engagement, bullying, and cyberbullying. Results: In the estimated psychological network, the node with the highest strength was depressive symptomatology, and that with the highest expected influence value was bullying. Suicidal behaviour was positively connected to symptoms of depression and behavioural problems. In addition, suicidal behaviour was negatively connected to self-esteem and personal well-being. The results of the stability analysis indicated that the network was accurately estimated. Conclusions: Suicidal behaviour can be conceptualised as a dynamic, complex system of cognitive, emotional, and affective characteristics. New psychological models allow us to analyse and understand human behaviour from a new perspective, suggesting new forms of conceptualisation, evaluation, intervention, and prevention.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is usually accompanied by a high suicide risk. The main aim was to identify the risk and protective factors involved in suicide risk in adolescents with bipolar experiences. Of a total of 1506 adolescents, 467 (31\%) were included in the group reporting bipolar experiences or symptoms, 214 males (45.8\%) and 253 (54.2\%) females. The mean age was 16.22 (SD = 1.36), with the age range between 14 and 19. Suicide risk, behavioral and emotional difficulties, prosocial capacities, well-being, and bipolar experiences were assessed through self-report. Mediation analyses, taking gender as a moderator and controlling age as a covariate, were applied to estimate suicide risk. The results indicated that the effect of bipolar experiences on suicide risk is mediated by behavioral and emotional difficulties rather than by prosocial behavior and subjective well-being. Specifically, emotional problems, problems with peers, behavior problems, and difficulties associated with hyperactivity were the most important variables. This relationship was not modulated by gender. However, the indirect effects of some mediators varied according to gender. These results support the development of suicide risk prevention strategies focused on reducing emotional difficulties, behavioral problems, and difficulties in relationships with others.},

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to residential green and blue spaces on anxiety and depression and intake of related medication. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential mediators and effect modifiers of this association. Methods The study was based on an existing adult cohort (ALFA -- Alzheimer and Families) and includes 958 adult participants from Barcelona recruited in 2013--2014. For each participant residential green and blue exposure indicators [surrounding greenness (NDVI), amount of green (land-cover) and access to major green spaces and blue spaces] were generated for different buffers (100m, 300m and 500m). Participants reported their history of doctor-diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders and intake of related medication. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the corresponding associations. Results Increasing surrounding greenness was associated with reduced odds of self-reported history of benzodiazepines [e.g. Odds ratio - OR (95\%CI) = 0.62 (0.43, 0.89) for 1-interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI in a 300m buffer] and access to major green spaces was associated with self-reported history of depression [OR (95\%CI) = 0.18 (0.06, 0.58)]. No statistically significant associations were observed with blue spaces. Air pollution (between 0.8\% and 29.6\%) and noise (between 2.2\% and 5.3\%) mediated a proportion of the associations observed, whereas physical activity and social support played a minor role. Conclusion Our findings suggest a potential protective role of green spaces on mental health (depression and anxiety) in adults, but further studies, especially longitudinal studies, are needed to provide further evidence of these benefits and of the mediation role of exposures like air pollution and noise.},

Entropy is used as an updated constraint to remove the erroneously identified stopping points, which leads to 1.5\% improvement in the overall accuracy compared with an earlier version of the methodology. The output from the first step also make the SVMs have a better performance.},

This paper proposes a two-step methodology (a density-based clustering algorithm in the first step and SVMs (support vector machines) in the second step) to deal with GPS data without speed or acceleration features which are usually used as key attributes in the rule-based methodologies. Entropy is used as an updated constraint to remove the erroneously identified stopping points, which leads to 1.5\% improvement in the overall accuracy compared with an earlier version of the methodology. The output from the first step also make the SVMs have a better performance.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies show a link between leisure engagement and subjective well-being (SWB). Drawing on common experiential features of leisure, psychological need theories, and bottom-up models of SWB, we suggest that leisure engagement influences SWB via leisure satisfaction. We examine the proposed cross-sectional relations and mediation model using random-effects meta-analyses that include all available populations. To provide a stronger test of causal influence, we also examine longitudinal relations between leisure satisfaction and SWB and effects of experimental leisure interventions on SWB using random effects meta-analyses of all available populations. Findings based on 37 effect sizes and 11,834 individuals reveal that leisure engagement and SWB are moderately associated (inverse-variance weighted r = .26) and mediated by leisure satisfaction. Cross-lagged regression analyses of longitudinal studies, controlling for prior SWB, reveal bottom-up effects of leisure satisfaction on SWB ({$\beta$} = .15) and top-down effects of SWB on leisure satisfaction ({$\beta$} = .16). Experimental studies reveal that leisure interventions enhance SWB (d = 1.02). Compared with working samples, retired samples exhibit a stronger relation between leisure engagement and SWB, and between leisure satisfaction and SWB. Measures of the frequency and diversity of leisure engagement are more strongly associated with SWB than measures of time spent in leisure. Overall, although not minimizing top-down influences, results are consistent with bottom-up models of SWB and suggest that the leisure domain is a potentially important target for enhancing SWB.},

Objective To assess how exposure to green space, blue space, noise, air pollution, and crowdedness along people's daily mobility paths are associated with anxiety symptoms. Methods 358 participants were cross-sectionally tracked with Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled mobile phones. Anxiety symptoms were measured at baseline using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. Green space, blue space, noise, and air pollution were assessed based on concentric buffers of 50 m and 100 m around each GPS point. Crowdedness was measured by the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices detected along the mobility paths. Multiple linear regressions with full covariate adjustment were fitted to examine anxiety-environmental exposures associations. Random forest models were applied to explore possible nonlinear associations and exposure interactions. Results Regression results showed null linear associations between GAD-7 scores and environmental exposures. Random forest models indicated that GAD-7-environment associations varied nonlinearly with exposure levels. We found a negative association between green space and GAD-7 scores only for participants with moderate green space exposure. We observed a positive association between GAD-7 scores and noise levels above 60 dB and air pollution concentrations above 17.2 {$\mu$}g m-3.

  abstract = {Approximately 1.5 to 3.5 million Americans have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a developmental disability characterized by social communication impairments, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. In the coming decade, a half-million persons with ASD in the United States will enter adulthood. Information on the transportation needs and challenges facing this population is limited, which hinders the development of sound policies and strategies to meet those needs successfully. This paper presents the findings from a series of focus groups conducted in New Jersey with adults with ASD and their parents or guardians. The focus groups were part of a larger study that included stakeholder interviews and a survey of this population on transportation-related issues and concerns. The findings provide evidence of the vital role of transportation in the lives of persons with ASD, especially as they seek to navigate the often difficult transition to adulthood. Transportation issues of special concern among all participants included an absence of transport options, lack of familiarity with public transportation modes, and cost factors. Parents were concerned about the safety of their adult children with ASD when they used public transportation. They also described the financial and emotional implications of being the primary transportation providers for their adult children. Adult participants with ASD discussed the difficulties of relying on their families for transportation and many conveyed a desire to use public transportation or to secure a driver's license, or both, as a means to achieve greater independence and employment success.},

Weightings were applied to make the results more representative of the national population with mental health conditions. Results 89\% of the respondents had anxiety and 76\% were depressed. The biggest cause of anxiety was interacting with fellow travellers, both in terms of how they behaved and how the respondents felt that others perceived them. The second main cause of anxiety was needing support when travelling, both feeling out of control and requiring help from other people. Having to feel in control reflected another cause of anxiety: having to take action in an unfamiliar environment, because the method of travel has failed or because of the need to find suitable toilet facilities. Wayfinding caused anxiety in terms of feelings of disorientation, being lost and having to find the way.

In an Internet survey, 1023 Swedish consumers rated satisfaction with major vs. fill-in shopping imagining they were under high or low time pressure. The results showed that satisfaction is higher for fill-in shopping than major shopping, that time pressure has no effect on satisfaction, and that price level, service quality, and product quality/range are more important for satisfaction with major shopping, whereas access is more important for satisfaction with fill-in shopping. It is also found that the importance of attributes for satisfaction depends on type of shopping more than on individual characteristics.},

  abstract = {People with anxiety disorders may encounter anxiety triggers when (planning to) travel(ing) to a destination, affecting their ability to actively participate in society. Using a Multiple Case Study Design, this paper aims to improve our knowledge on mobility-related problems experienced by people with anxiety disorders and their potential impact on these people's daily life. In-depth interviews were held with 40 Dutch adults officially diagnosed with anxiety disorders by professionals in the field of psychology. Data revealed that most interviewees experience a mix of problems in using various transport modes. Interviewees often experience the feeling of being locked up and not being able to escape as anxiety triggers. They perceive the mobility system as complex and overwhelming, while mobility-related information can trigger panic attacks or lower respondents' stress level. Interviewees employ a variety of coping mechanisms: avoidance of transport modes; avoidance of highways, bridges, tunnels; remaining in a familiar, predictable environment; asking for social support when travel is necessary; and searching for adequate travel information to use before and during travel. Coping with anxiety disorders and mobility-related problems may have far-reaching impacts on professional life, including job switching and job relocation. The study shows that it is challenging to define the boundaries of the topic under study and almost impossible to develop a `one-size-fits-all' approach to alleviate this population's problems. We end with directions for further research into transport interventions that could benefit people with anxiety disorders.},

These mechanisms are proposed to be maintained by low negative affect and high positive affect, although less is known about these mechanisms and SWB in autism. The current cross-sectional study aimed to compare patterns of positive affect, negative affect (Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale), and SWB (Personal Wellbeing Index-School Children) between autistic (n = 53) and non-autistic (n = 49) individuals aged 10--22 years (Mage = 13.97, SD = 3.13). Between-group t-tests revealed that compared with same-age peers, autistic participants scored lower SWB overall (p {$<$} 0.001). In both groups average SWB scores fell into the higher range, however, autistic participants were three-times more likely to fall below this range when compared to non-autistic participants. Negative affect had a higher intercept in the autistic sample, but no difference in slopes were observed. A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that diagnosis, positive affect, and negative affect significantly predicted SWB in our sample. Between-group t-tests found no significant difference in positive affect or negative affect across age between the autistic and non-autistic samples. In autistic participants, positive affect increased across age as SWB decreased, whilst negative affect remained stable, a pattern inconsistent with homeostatic SWB. The current study is overall consistent with the homeostatic explanation for SWB within autism; however, we identified potential differences between autistic and non-autistic participants in the contribution of positive affect and negative affect to homeostatic protect mood across development.},

  abstract = {Contact with green space in the environment has been associated with mental health benefits, but the mechanism underpinning this association is not clear. This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35--55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation.},

To examine associations of perceived neighbourhood "greenness" with perceived physical and mental health and to investigate whether walking and social factors account for the relationships. A mailed survey collected the following data from adults (n = 1895) in Adelaide, Australia: physical and mental health scores (12-item short-form health survey); perceived neighbourhood greenness; walking for recreation and for transport; social coherence; local social interaction and sociodemographic variables. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, those who perceived their neighbourhood as highly green had 1.37 and 1.60 times higher odds of better physical and mental health, respectively, compared with those who perceived the lowest greenness. Perceived greenness was also correlated with recreational walking and social factors. When walking for recreation and social factors were added to the regression models, recreational walking was a significant predictor of physical health; however, the association between greenness and physical health became non-significant. Recreational walking and social coherence were associated with mental health and the relationship between greenness and mental health remained significant. Perceived neighbourhood greenness was more strongly associated with mental health than it was with physical health. Recreational walking seemed to explain the link between greenness and physical health, whereas the relationship between greenness and mental health was only partly accounted for by recreational walking and social coherence. The restorative effects of natural environments may be involved in the residual association of this latter relationship.},

The effect is likely associated with resilience as the broaden-and-build theory suggests positive emotions elicited from leisure increase mental resources for stress coping. The present research examined whether participating in different leisure activities at a given time increases the level of resilience, which in turn reduces psychological problems. It also investigated the changes in people's leisure activities due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of these changes on their mental health. Japanese participants (N\,=\,300) responded to two online surveys conducted before (January 2020) and after the outbreak (February 2021). They selected the leisure activities they had engaged in from 100 choices and reported their levels of resilience and depressive symptoms. An analysis of covariates revealed that the total number of selected activities significantly reduced in the second survey, but the levels of resilience and depressive symptoms remained constant. Regression analysis showed that the reduction in leisure activities did not predict depressive symptoms. However, structural equation modeling established that the relationship between leisure and depression was mediated by resilience, supporting the initial hypothesis. Importantly, this relationship slightly differed by age group, likely because popular activities and their psychological impacts vary depending on age.},

It provides the background information necessary to better understand the complex relationship between urban structure, the transportation system and household travel patterns. To what extent do travel behaviour reflect the properties of the urban structure and the transportation network, or do these patterns largely follow their own regularities? Can different patterns be observed across different space-time settings, or can common patterns be observed, largely independent from such contexts? To better understand these relationships, this paper reports on some of the findings of analyses, conducted to identify underlying structures in various aspects of travel patterns. Travel patterns, derived from activity and travel diary data collected in Portland (USA), Midlands (UK), Fukuoka (Japan), Canadian metropolitan areas, and the South-Rotterdam region (The Netherlands) are compared. The results indicate that travel patterns are largely independent from spatial setting, except for some extreme cases.},

  abstract = {When the global positioning system became available for civil uses in the early 1990s, there was an enthusiasm and anticipation that information stored in GPS data streams would replace the traditional data collection methods, especially in the transportation field. Despite the wealth of GPS surveys available to practitioners to work with, the existing studies have not made much progress to deliver models for identification of activities from GPS data streams. The lack of models for identifying activities prevents the reconstruction of activity patterns stored in GPS data streams. The present study proposes a methodology for the identification of activities using a rule-based and discrete choice modeling. This novel approach uses a rule-based model that implements the properties of home-based tours in the form of the feedback loop in order to allow identification of home activities. This model is inert to the presence of travel characteristics as it can be applied to most multi-day GPS data sets, and not just prompted recall surveys. In regard to the non-home activities, a discrete choice model is calibrated to Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), for identification of work and other activities. The estimated results are positive, as they are compared against the TTS, and are consistent with the observed patterns.},

  abstract = {When the global positioning system became available for civil uses in the early 1990s, there was an enthusiasm and anticipation that information stored in GPS data streams would replace the traditional data collection methods, especially in the transportation field. Despite the wealth of GPS surveys available to practitioners to work with, the existing studies have not made much progress to deliver models for identification of activities from GPS data streams. The lack of models for identifying activities prevents the reconstruction of activity patterns stored in GPS data streams. The present study proposes a methodology for the identification of activities using a rule-based and discrete choice modeling. This novel approach uses a rule-based model that implements the properties of home-based tours in the form of the feedback loop in order to allow identification of home activities. This model is inert to the presence of travel characteristics as it can be applied to most multi-day GPS data sets, and not just prompted recall surveys. In regard to the non-home activities, a discrete choice model is calibrated to Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS), for identification of work and other activities. The estimated results are positive, as they are compared against the TTS, and are consistent with the observed patterns.},

  abstract = {Living near, recreating in, and feeling psychologically connected to, the natural world are all associated with better mental health, but many exposure-related questions remain. Using data from an 18-country survey (n\,=\,16,307) we explored associations between multiple measures of mental health (positive well-being, mental distress, depression/anxiety medication use) and: (a) exposures (residential/recreational visits) to different natural settings (green/inland-blue/coastal-blue spaces); and (b) nature connectedness, across season and country. People who lived in greener/coastal neighbourhoods reported higher positive well-being, but this association largely disappeared when recreational visits were controlled for. Frequency of recreational visits to green, inland-blue, and coastal-blue spaces in the last 4~weeks were all positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress. Associations with green space visits were relatively consistent across seasons and countries but associations with blue space visits showed greater heterogeneity. Nature connectedness was also positively associated with positive well-being and negatively associated with mental distress and was, along with green space visits, associated with a lower likelihood of using medication for depression. By contrast inland-blue space visits were associated with a greater likelihood of using anxiety medication. Results highlight the benefits of multi-exposure, multi-response, multi-country studies in exploring complexity in nature-health associations.},

Trip characteristics, including trip ends, travel modes, and trip purposes need to be detected from GPS data. Compared with other trip characteristics, studies on trip purpose detection are limited. These studies struggle with three types of limitations, namely, data validation, classification approach-related issues, and result comparison under multiple scenarios. Therefore, we attempt to obtain full understanding and improve these three aspects when detecting trip purposes in the current study. First, a smartphone-based travel survey is employed to collect GPS data, and a surveyor-intervened prompted recall survey is used to validate trip characteristics automatically detected from the GPS data. Second, artificial neural networks combined with particle swarm optimization are used to detect trip purposes from the GPS data. Third, four scenarios are constructed by employing two methods for land-use type coding, i.e., polygon-based information and point of interest, and two methods for selecting training dataset, i.e., equal proportion selection and equal number selection. The accuracy of trip purpose detection is then compared under these scenarios. The highest accuracies of 97.22\% for the training dataset and 96.53\% for the test dataset are achieved under the scenario of polygon-based information and equal proportion selection by comparing the detected and validated trip purposes. Promising results indicate that a smartphone-based travel survey can complement conventional travel surveys.},

Controlling for other variables that might explain such a relationship, we found that negative social interactions were significantly related to lower QOL in three subjective domains, while supportive social interactions were related to higher QOL in four objective domains and one subjective domain. We found negative social interactions that are stigmatizing to be particularly important in predicting QOL; additional analyses suggested that perceived stigma partially mediated the relationship between negative social interactions and QOL. We discuss the implications of the present findings for the study of the link between social relationships and QOL among persons with mental illness.},

  abstract = {This study examined the mediating effect of regulatory emotional self-efficacy and the moderating effect of meaning in life on the relationship between social anxiety and subjective well-being among Chinese college students. Nine hundred and eight Chinese students (Mage~=~20.14, SD~=~1.71; 49\% males) completed self-reported questionnaires regarding social anxiety, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, meaning in life, and subjective well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the relation between social anxiety and subjective well-being and the moderated mediation model. The results revealed that regulatory emotional self-efficacy fully mediated the link between social anxiety and college students' subjective well-being. College students' meaning in life moderated the associations between social anxiety and college students' regulatory emotional self-efficacy and between regulatory emotional self-efficacy and subjective well-being. Particularly, the link between social anxiety and regulatory emotional self-efficacy was only significant for those with lower meaning in life. The association between regulatory emotional self-efficacy and subjective well-being was more robust for those with higher meaning in life. This study identified the critical factors associated with subjective well-being; it supplies empirical support for existing theories and provides practical implications for interventions aiming to improve Chinese college students' subjective well-being.},

  abstract = {The issues of mental health such as depression and anxiety create impact to the psychological, social and economic of society. Public libraries as a community center play a great role in taking actions toward mental health and well-being through bibliotherapy services. This study aims to describe the public libraries experienced in bibliotherapy and to determine the criteria of bibliotherapy services in public libraries. A systematic literature search of studies was carried out based on the PRISMA framework. The analysis of the literatures revealed a large variety of bibliotherapy framework and models -- most of them are developed in country-specific and only applicable in western countries, others could be applied by public libraries across borders. The review makes clear that bibliotherapy services are importance in libraries and requires specific criteria for bibliotherapy development. It also clearly outlines the potential of bibliotherapy services in libraries as a method of improving mental health and well-being. The article raises important issues with regards to how public library should go about developing bibliotherapy services. This study contributes to the field of library and information management as it highlights the public libraries experienced in implementing bibliotherapy. Library practitioners could use the results to develop their strategies to ensure the success of the bibliotherapy as part of library services.},
