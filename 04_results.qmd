## Applications
```{r setup, file = "R/chapter_start.R", include = FALSE}
# a number of commands need to run at the beginning of each chapter. This
# includes loading libraries that I always use, as well as options for 
# displaying numbers and text.
```

```{r setup2, include = FALSE}
# Other packages ------
# These are packages that get used in this chapter but aren't part of the default set.
```


```{r optim}
res <- read_csv("data/optim_scaled_2024-02-12.csv", col_names = c('eps', 'minpts', 'delta_t', 'entr_t', 'error')) |> 
  mutate(iteration = row_number()) 

res |> 
  pivot_longer(-iteration) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = iteration, y = value)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y")
```

```{r}
final <- res |> filter(iteration == max(iteration)) 
```

Final values are `r final$error/13`
