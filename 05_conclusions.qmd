# Conclusions {#sec-conclude}

This research explored the critical link between travel behavior and mental health, focusing on young adults with suicidal ideation.
By analyzing daily activities and movement patterns, we identified significant differences in activity engagement and motivation levels across three groups: autistic individuals, individuals with social anxiety, and a control group.
The findings underscore the distinct challenges faced by each group and the importance of considering these factors in mental health interventions.

We found that individuals in the control group participated in more activities and reported higher motivation on average, while autistic individuals and those with social anxiety engaged in fewer activities and had lower motivation levels.
We also found that the relationship between activity participation and motivation is not uniform across groups.
A small positive relationship existed between the total number of activities and motivation levels overall.
However, only individuals with social anxiety showed a statistically significant increase in motivation with more activity engagement.
This suggests that increasing the number of activities may be particularly beneficial for enhancing well-being in individuals with social anxiety.

Activity location also played a critical role in shaping motivation.
Park visits over a seven-day period were associated with a significant increase in motivation for the control group, suggesting that outdoor green spaces may promote mental well-being in the general population.
Conversely, for autistic individuals, grocery store visits were significantly linked to decreased motivation, indicating that these environments may be sources of stress or discomfort.
These location-specific trends highlight the importance of not just how much individuals participate in activities, but where these activities take place.

The practical implications of these findings are profound.
Understanding how travel behavior influences motivation and mental health can guide mental health practitioners in developing targeted strategies.
For example, interventions could focus on mitigating the stressors of grocery store environments for autistic individuals or promoting greater activity engagement for individuals with social anxiety to enhance their well-being.

Overall, this research bridges the gap between travel behavior and mental health, highlighting the importance of personalized approaches to mental health care.
By considering travel behavior as a key factor in promoting well-being, we provide a roadmap for future research that can further explore this intersection, ultimately aiming to enhance the quality of life for individuals by informing more personalized and effective mental health strategies.
