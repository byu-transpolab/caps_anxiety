# Limitations and Future Recommendations

There are some important limitations and future considerations following this initial analysis of the research.

## **Duration of Engagement and Device Usage**

The primary limitation of this study pertains to the quality of the data of the participants. Since participants participated for varying lengths of time and their phones were not always operational, the data was sparse in some cases. Since the userID-activity days needed corresponding mental health data and activity data, we tried to account for the gaps by imputing the number of activities for a seven-day rolling average number of activities and by calculating the convex hull area and the distance traveled. Even though a substantial amount of data had to be discarded due to poor quality, influenced by factors such as participants turning off their phones or the app failing to record data accurately, we did our best to accurately account for the well-being and activity patterns of the idividuals. The inconsistency in data collection may have made it difficult for the DBSCAN-TE algorithm to perfectly identify activities. While it performed with about 91% accuracy, some of the activity days that were manually checked appeared to be missing identified activities. Improved data quality would likely have mitigated these issues.

To address these limitations in future studies, improving data quality would be paramount. Strategies could include implementing measures to encourage consistent phone usage among participants or enhancing the app's reliability in recording data accurately. Additionally, incorporating redundancy measures within the data collection process, such as cross-referencing data from multiple sources or employing complementary data collection methods, could help mitigate the impact of sporadic data collection. Moreover, refining algorithms like DBSCAN-TE to improve accuracy and robustness in identifying activities, potentially through machine learning techniques or incorporating additional contextual information, could enhance the reliability of activity data. By prioritizing efforts to enhance data quality and implementing more robust data collection and processing procedures, future studies can better capture and analyze individuals' mental health and activity patterns, thereby yielding more accurate and insightful findings.

## **Incomplete Activity Duration Data**

The study also lacks detailed information on the duration of participants' activities. While the dataset indicates that certain activities occurred, it does not specify how long participants spent engaging in these activities. For example, we know whether participants visited parks, but not the duration of their stay. This limitation means we cannot accurately assess the impact of time spent in specific environments on mental well-being. Additionally, since the algorithm was determining activities based on location data, we did not account for instances where participants might have merely passed through green spaces or parks without spending significant time there. This omission further complicates our understanding of the relationship between environment and mental health. In addition, such inaccuracies in location tracking can lead to a misrepresentation of participants' behaviors and routines, ultimately affecting the validity of our findings regarding the relationship between travel behavior and mental well-being. These limitations highlight the challenges in using mobile-based data collection for mental health research.

Future studies coould focus on improving the accuracy of location-tracking algorithms, ensuring consistent data collection, and capturing detailed activity duration to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between travel behavior and mental well-being.

## **Activity Diaries**

One potential limitation of our study is the inability to confirm which specific activities individuals participated in throughout the day. While we have identified activities using the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, there is a possibility that certain activities were not accurately identified by the algorithm, leading to their omission from our analysis. This lack of precision could potentially result in some activities going undetected, thereby limiting the comprehensiveness of our activity analysis.

To address this limitation in future research, integrating activity diaries into our survey methodology could prove beneficial. By incorporating activity diaries, participants would have the opportunity to provide detailed accounts of their daily activities, including specific locations where these activities took place. This additional information could enhance the completeness and accuracy of our activity analysis, as it would provide valuable insights into the types and locations of activities individuals engage in throughout the day.

Overall, while our current approach utilizing the DBSCAN-TE algorithm provides valuable insights into overall activity patterns, the incorporation of activity diaries in future surveys could further enrich our understanding by capturing a more comprehensive picture of individuals' daily activities and their contextual relevance.
