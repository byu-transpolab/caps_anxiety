# Limitations and Future Recommendations

This study has several important limitations that affect the accuracy and completeness of the data.
First, the quality and consistency of data collection varied across participants.
Since participants were enrolled for different lengths of time and their phones were not always on or properly recording, some of the LBS data was sparse or missing.
As a result, a some data had to be excluded, and the DBSCAN-TE algorithm may not have consistently or accurately identified all activities.
Although we used methods like rolling averages and imputation to address gaps, decreasing the inconsistencies in data collection could improve the precision of our findings.

Second, while we could identify *where* participants went, we lacked data on *how long* they spent at each location.
For example, a visit to a park was recorded, but we couldn't tell whether the participant stayed for several hours or just passed through.
This limits our ability to assess the relationship between time spent in certain environments and mental well-being.
Because the algorithm detects activities based on stationary data, short or passive visits may not reflect meaningful engagement with a location.

Finally, the DBSCAN-TE algorithm, while useful, cannot fully confirm the exact nature of participants' activities.
Itâ€™s possible that some activities were misclassified or missed altogether.
Without direct input from participants, such as activity diaries, we cannot be certain which specific activities took place.

To address these limitations, future studies should focus on improving data quality and collection consistency, perhaps by encouraging regular phone use and ensuring the tracking app functions reliably.
Capturing the duration of time spent at activity locations and supplementing LBS data with participant-reported activity diaries could also improve the accuracy and depth of analysis.
These additions would help researchers gain a more comprehensive understanding of how different types of activities, and the time spent doing them, relate to mental well-being.
